In Season 3 (spoiler alert!), tensions rise as Robert’s wedding draws closer and he and Frances butt heads over their parenting styles. On the sidelines, Diane (Molly Shannon) searches for independence while her husband sits in prison, and Dallas (Talia Balsam) wrestles with a midlife crisis. Writing in The New York Times, James Poniewozik said the show isn’t “going to reinvent the breakup comedy or the HBO comedy.

0,"“The Peach Truck Cookbook” has recipes for Dutch baby pancakes, cucumber gazpacho and pizza.","Stephen and Jessica Rose couldn’t find juicy, fragrant fresh peaches in Nashville, where they settled as newlyweds, so they did something about it. In 2012 the couple bought bushels of peaches — Mr. Rose is from Fort Valley, Ga., and was familiar with Pearson Farm there — loaded the fruit in a 1964 Jeep Gladiator and drove around Nashville selling them on weekends in summer. They are still at it with their peach truck, and visit more than 100 cities each summer. Now the couple has a cookbook that explains peach varieties, the history of the fruit in America and how to store, ripen and peel your peaches (though they don’t mention the serrated peeler I use for the job). Adding peaches to Dutch baby pancakes, to a cucumber gazpacho, to poundcake, to a Caprese salad and to condiments for pork and salmon are first-rate suggestions. I’m not sure I need peaches on pizza or with a steak, but when you’re in the peach business there are no limits.

Imagine if Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” were told from Ophelia’s perspective. This film, directed by Claire McCarthy, follows Ophelia (Daisey Ridley), a Danish orphan who becomes a lady in waiting to Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts). Soon she and a young Prince Hamlet (George MacKay) fall in love. But Ophelia’s devotion is tested as Hamlet’s desire to avenge his father’s death overtakes him. In her review in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote: “‘Ophelia’ seeks to revamp the image of its title heroine as a tragic, largely passive casualty, one who is as much a victim of Shakespeare’s era as of his peerless imagination. It’s an interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Last Czars’ and ‘Peterloo’,Movies;Television,2019-07-03,article,Arts,News

He bounds through crowds of defenders with two giant steps, then dunks almost as an afterthought. He makes impossible last-second game-winning shots as casually as the rest of us might toss our car keys into a bowl on the coffee table. Once, using the subtlest of shot fakes, Durant sent LeBron James sliding helplessly to the floor, out of bounds, and then cruised politely forward for two points.

Or at least the ’80s as shown through the Spielbergian lens of this Netflix sci-fi horror series, which follows a group of Midwestern youths coming-of-age in a town that exists in the shadow of the supernatural. Season 2 ramped up the emotion and romance amid the chaos. Season 3 finds the friends in the summer between middle school and high school — so it’ll probably be downright terrifying. (In an interview with The New York Times, the actor Cary Elwes, who plays the town mayor this season, mentioned “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” as a primary influence for Season 3.) The neon nostalgia factor runs high.  “I always wonder if Apple iPhones and all these electronics that we use today are still going to be a thing in like 10, 20 years,” the actor Noah Schnapp, who plays one of the friends, recently told The Times. “It’s nice being on set, because it teaches you, oh, you don’t need your phone all the time.

Amanda and Lily are a pair of erstwhile friends brought back together by circumstance: The studious Lily is enlisted to tutor Amanda, whose troubled nature is bared at the beginning of the movie, when she kills her injured horse with a knife.

Although Malek’s performance earned him an Oscar for best actor, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film doesn’t do enough to capture “the glorious and unlikely artifice of Queen itself, a band whose scrambling of sexual and musical codes remains a remarkable phenomenon in the history of popular culture.”",What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and ‘Enchanted Kingdom’,Television;Movies,2019-07-06,article,Arts,News

The series kicks off with a two-hour premiere focusing on the films of the 1980s, from sci-fi hits like “E.T.” “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Back to the Future” to comedies like “The Breakfast Club” and “Coming to America.” The episode pairs perfectly with the new season of “Stranger Things” on Netflix, and will likely be a great primer for that show’s many ’80s references.",What’s on TV Sunday: ‘The Movies’ and ‘Outlander’,Television;Movies,2019-07-07,article,Arts,News

0,The “Scream” reboot returns for a third season. And a new documentary series about the space race comes to PBS.,"SCREAM: RESURRECTION 9 p.m. on VH1. When this television adaptation of Wes Craven’s horror franchise debuted in 2015, critics argued that the story didn’t pack the same punch on the small screen. Some said the series lacked novelty and that the Ghostface killer doesn’t send chills down your spine over 10 drawn-out episodes. Season 3 brings the show from MTV to VH1 and packs terror in three two-hour episodes airing over three nights. The unlucky protagonist is Deion (RJ Cyler), a high school jock in Atlanta who is haunted by the death of his brother and by a mysterious killer who is sending him eerie messages. After Deion lands in detention, he and a few classmates form the “Deadfast Club” and set out to find the man behind the mask. As in previous seasons, “Resurrection” offers plenty of meta references: One character plainly states, “We’re in a horror movie.” Another says, “This here is a reboot, and reboots don’t play by your rules.” ",What’s on TV Monday: ‘Scream’ and ‘Chasing the Moon’,Movies;Television,2019-07-08,article,Arts,News

0,A four-part documentary about the record producer Rick Rubin begins. And Denzel Washington occupies both sides of the moral coin (or subway token).,"SHANGRI-LA 9 p.m. on Showtime. The fabled Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, Calif., was once a hangout for the Band and Bob Dylan.

So it makes sense as a setting for this four-part documentary from the director Morgan Neville (“Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”), which takes a meandering dive into Rubin’s life and work as a producer. The fact that Rubin has worked across so many genres (his best-known collaborations include producing for acts like the Beastie Boys and Johnny Cash) means that this dive should have something for everyone. But as the title suggests, the star may be the studio itself. “There’s an extra, added feeling of coming to a place where a lot of good music has been made,” Rubin says in the first episode. “I don’t know if it’s the energy collected in the space, or if it’s just people’s belief,” he adds. “It doesn’t really matter.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Shangri-La’ and Two Denzel Washington Movies,Television;Movies,2019-07-12,article,Arts,News

But those already feeling separation anxiety can take comfort in the presence of this filmed version, captured last year at the Adelphi Theater in London’s West End. While many have strutted with the boots since the show debuted in Chicago in 2012, this version stars Matt Henry as Lola, a role for which he won an Olivier Award. Killian Donnelly stars opposite him, as the struggling shoe factory owner Charlie. Both performers were part of the original London cast. The show is “a shameless emotional button pusher, presided over — be warned — by that most weary of latter-day Broadway archetypes, a strong and sassy drag queen who dispenses life lessons like an automated fortune cookie,” Ben Brantley wrote in his review of the Broadway production for The New York Times in 2013. “Yet, for a good while, ‘Kinky Boots’ manages to ride over the skeptical grumbling of your conscious mind.”",What’s on TV Monday: ‘Kinky Boots’ and ‘Spectre’,Television;Movies,2019-07-15,article,Arts,News

0,A new fermented honey sauce brings sweet and spicy flavors to whatever it touches.,"Anya’s Apothekere makes an unusual fermented honey sauce in three flavors: garlic, onion and jalapeño. The nutty, sweet syrup picks up notes of each ingredient added, and the vegetables pieces are, in turn, sweetened. The peppery taste of the jalapeño kicks long after a swallow, whereas the garlic is more subtle, with a strong earthy flavor that cuts under the toffee-flavored base. Anya Corson, the founder and chief executive of the St. Louis company, drew upon her culinary school training to create the probiotic preserve. The honey, added ingredients and splash of apple cider vinegar are all raw and organic, as is the wild yeast that works on the mixture over its three-month fermentation. It would make an unexpected addition to a charcuterie board, perhaps as an alternative to fig jam.

But as I listened to Donald Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign that spring, the class took on a new dimension. Would my students understand the long history that informed a comment like one Trump made when he announced his presidential candidacy? “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” When I heard those words, I wanted my students to track immigration laws in the United States.

0,Big business loves to flash cultural credentials,"The Seagram liquor company and the ancient Mesoamerican civilization of the Olmecs were not obvious bedfellows. But in 1965, a crane operator lowered a colossal Olmec sculpture of a head onto the corporation’s Manhattan doorstep. The artwork was awe-inspiring enough that its next stop was the World’s Fair, but, for a time, it sat in front of Seagram’s new Mies van der Rohe skyscraper on Park Avenue. Hosting the sculpture was an audacious move on the company’s part. The juxtaposition of the Olmecs’ pockmarked basalt and the building’s sleek glass and bronze exterior made a statement about where mankind had been and where it was going. Also, intentionally or not, it was a pretty epic pun on the phrase “how to get ahead in business.”",When Corporate Lobbies Started to Look Like Museum Galleries,Art;Corporations;JPMorgan Chase & Company;Seagram Company Limited (The);Mesoamerica;OLMEC CIVILIZATION,2019-07-19,article,Business Day,News

0,"Celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing with “First Man,” “For All Mankind” and more.","FIRST MAN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. “Feelings are the film’s fuel,” A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. “Like some of the ancient epics ‘First Man’ is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center."" Ryan Gosling, collaborating with “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansen’s biography and contrasts Armstrong’s reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered. We watch as he and his wife (Claire Foy) grieve over the loss of their daughter, prepare for the launch and wrestle with the fact that Armstrong could go down in history as the first man to walk on the moon — or perish in outer space.

This documentary tells the story of Nora Sandigo, a Miami woman who serves as the guardian to more than 1,000 children who were born in the United States to undocumented immigrants. Sandigo, who fled Nicaragua as a teenager, moved to Florida in the late 1980s, where she started working for an organization that helped immigrants with documentation. After President Trump took office, many parents in the immigrant community started to give Sandigo power of attorney, so that she could make decisions for their United States-born children, should they be deported. This designation protects the children in Sandigo’s care from entering the foster care system, keeping them from being legally separated from their parents. When Sandigo is not making grocery runs, contacting lawyers or trying to find beds for the hundreds of people she looks after, she makes trips to Washington to meet with lawmakers to discuss immigration policy. The filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad Walker followed Sandigo over two years during and following the 2016 election for this documentary.",What’s on TV Monday: ‘The Great Mother’ and ‘Time Freak’,Television;Movies,2019-07-22,article,Arts,News

0,Feel for the mussels in the muddy riverbed. Check the ones with misshapen shells. Don’t expect to make a living this way.,"“Run your hands back and forth through the sediment at the bottom of the river,” says Chuck Work, who has spent much of the last 25 years underwater, crawling the muddy bed of the Tennessee River, feeling for mussels with his hands. Misshapen shells are much likelier to contain freshwater pearls than more uniform ones. Open any deformed bivalve you find by sticking a knife in its hinge. “Twist the blade and it pops open,” Work says. Squeeze the soft meat in your hand, feeling for something hard. On a typical day, Work will collect as many as 1,500 mussels and check only a few for pearls; his more dependable pay comes from selling the shells to a company that ships them to China and Japan, where they are cut into tiny pieces and forced into oysters, becoming the nuclei of cultured pearls. Only about one in 10,000 mussels contains a commercially valuable wild pearl. “You can’t make a living diving for pearls,” Work says. “Think of them as a bonus.”",How to Dive for Pearls,Mussels;Pearls;Tennessee,2019-07-23,article,Magazine,News

The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word “red,” often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. “It’s our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up,” Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. “The part of Tibet where I’m from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors,” Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. They’ll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from à la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. They’re just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas.

0,But that doesn’t mean we should stop using it.,"The Food and Drug Administration almost never tests products itself. But in May, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of a randomized trial, conducted by F.D.A. researchers, to determine whether the chemicals in four commercially available sunscreens are absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream. Four times daily, subjects were coated in one of the formulas in an amount determined to be the maximum a person might use: two milligrams per square centimeter of skin over 75 percent of the body. Later, blood samples were drawn and analyzed. All of the sunscreen chemicals were detected in concentrations that exceeded an F.D.A. threshold past which manufacturers are required to do further toxicology tests. “People who use sunscreens very reasonably presume they have been tested and are safe and effective,” says Kanade Shinkai, a dermatologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and an author of an editorial accompanying the JAMA study. “And we don’t really have that evidence.”","When You Wear Sunscreen, You’re Taking Part in a Safety Study",Sunscreen;Skin Cancer;Research;Melanomas,2019-07-23,article,Magazine,News

0,A new documentary on Netflix looks at the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And Anne Hathaway stars opposite Matthew McConaughey in “Serenity.”,"THE GREAT HACK (2019) Stream on Netflix. In her 2013 documentary, “The Square,” the director Jehane Noujaim captured Egypt from the winter of 2011 to the summer of 2013, during a time of political unrest and revolution lubricated by social media. The results of Noujaim’s work, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, were “stunning.” This new documentary, made by Noujaim and the filmmaker Karim Amer, is more directly concerned with social networks: It turns its attention to the commodification of personal data, with a focus on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the way American Facebook users’ data was harvested in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The principal figure through which that story gets dissected is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive who became an outspoken defector. Also interviewed are the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie and the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who was an author of a collaborative report between The Times and The Observer that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users. In that article, Wylie described the company as an “arsenal of weapons” in a culture war.

On that occasion, the story was about a man who was cutting down trees on his property and somehow touched his chain saw to a steel wire.

0,A roundup of things our editors — and a few contributors — are excited about in a given week.,"Swimwear, according to the designer Maayan Sherris, has to perform simultaneous tasks that your day-to-day clothes do not: it must both support the body and also move with its contours, all while under water. It’s a challenge that the Parsons graduate eagerly tackled in 2015 during a research project with the Columbia University women’s swim team, for which she translated the athletes’ needs into a line of sensible bikinis and functional one-pieces. “I like that my clothing serves a purpose,” Sherris said about the swimsuit label Babes in Bathers, which she launched in 2016 using her findings from that project. Now, after two years of development, the brand is ready to introduce a more expansive men’s offering that, in keeping with Sherris’s objective, addresses the needs and preferences of real swimmers. “I wanted to make sure I had a comfortable swimsuit that fits really well to the male body,” she said.","T Suggests: Taiwanese Pastries, Art Deco-Inspired Block Prints and More",Bakeries and Baked Products;Bathing Suits and Swimwear;Design;Skin,2019-07-26,article,T Magazine,News

It shows Mandy lying on the floor unconscious, while her crush (Nicholas Galitzine) removes her clothes. But it’s what the video doesn’t show that propels the film, as Mandy works to uncover the truth, growing more isolated in the process. “Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

0,Alice Feiring’s new book takes a deep dive into the additive-free world of winemaking.,"In her slender new book, the wine writer Alice Feiring deconstructs natural wine, the trend that’s sweeping the wine world. Ms. Feiring, whose middle name should be “terroir,” starts by describing what natural wine is not: It lacks the fruit, power and oak of some high-end wines. Ms. Feiring takes the same approach to wine as she does to food, avoiding anything highly processed and additive-laden, and explains all the additives used in conventional wine production that natural winemakers don’t use. But she also gets into weedy details; amateurs might prefer to ignore sections on stuff like reverse-osmosis and infusion, and concentrate instead on how wine gets its color, the use or presence of sulfur in wine, how to find natural wines and why you should care. And if you’re planning a trip to France or a few other countries and want to visit natural wineries, she includes some guidance.","Natural Wines, Explained","Feiring, Alice;Wines;Books and Literature;Ten Speed Press;Natural Wine for the People: What It Is, Where to Find It, How to Love It (Book)",2019-07-29,article,Food,News

The 15th season of this reality dating show may be remembered more for a relationship that didn’t work out than for the one the bachelorette, Hannah Brown, ultimately chooses. Earlier this season, as Brown was deciding between her final four suitors, one of them, Luke, questioned her faith and morality while telling her that he’d want to leave the show if she had been intimate with any other contestants. What followed was a dramatic, sex-positive defense from Brown that culminated in Luke’s departure, after she told him that she did have sex “and Jesus still loves me.” In the second night of this two-part finale, Brown could end up engaged to one of the final two contestants, but her resounding refusal to be judged may outshine any televised proposal.",What’s on TV Tuesday: The ‘Bachelorette’ Finale and Whitney Cummings,Television;Movies,2019-07-30,article,Arts,News

0,"“Sherman’s Showcase” debuts on IFC. And after five seasons on the CW, “Jane the Virgin” comes to a close.","SHERMAN’S SHOWCASE 10 p.m. on IFC. Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle, two former writers for “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,” have had a very busy month. Last week, the pair debuted “South Side,” their new Comedy Central sitcom about two friends in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago. And this week sees the beginning of “Sherman’s Showcase,” another show from Salahuddin and Riddle, which is built around a tribute to a fictional variety show. It plays off vintage series like “Soul Train” and “Laugh-In,” and makes a nostalgic vessel for the pair’s humor. In this case, those sensibilities even carry over into fake commercials for real products like VHS tapes — “watch movies in your own house for just 200 dollars a tape!” — and the dating website Black People Meet. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Salahuddin described the show as an “an absurd, heightened world where we can play.” He added, “It allows us to tap into that other part of our brain that’s silly and carefree.” And in a review for The Times, Mike Hale called the show “a pure jolt of stylized nostalgia, from its affectionate sendups of soul, R&B and hip-hop to its candy-colored sets with their abstract cutouts, traversed by roller-skating dancers.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Sherman’s Showcase’ and ‘Jane the Virgin’,Television;Movies,2019-07-31,article,Arts,News

For one officer, the return meant facing a perfunctory public welcome and superficial support. “The quick abandonment of interest in our overseas men by Americans in general,” he observed three years after the Armistice, “is an indictment against us as a nation, not soon to be forgotten by the men in uniform from the other side.” The soldier, a former Army officer later identified as Herbert B. Hayden, anonymously published his observations in an essay for The Atlantic Monthly. The severe effects of combat-related injuries, like the ones Hayden described in his essay, drew more public attention during the 1920s, when the figure of the shellshocked veteran became part of larger debates over the government’s responsibility to care for its military forces.",The Army’s Message to Returning World War I Troops?
