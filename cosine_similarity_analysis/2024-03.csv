0,"Sip teas inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, learn to cook the cuisine of Punjab and more food news.","Some cutting-edge appliances like the air fryer may have risen in popularity lately, but the simple sheet pan has become as essential as a cast-iron skillet. In the past, the sheet pan was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used in kitchens to make the cake known as chocolate roulade; it’s now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sanaë Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, “Hot Sheet,” you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point.

It will change monthly; the lineup for March is arugula salad, bucatini cacio e pepe, roast chicken breast with mushrooms, and chocolate mousse. A brief wine list of half and whole bottles is gently priced with a bottle of Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Chablis for $38, a bottle of Mas de Daumas Gassac cabernet sauvignon for $65, a half-bottle of Ridge Lytton Springs zinfandel for $42, and a half-bottle of Krug Grand Cuvée for $110. “I’ve gone from six restaurants and 650 employees to just four, and I can make money here,” Mr. Murphy said. When not serving dinners, the space houses his events company, MM Kitchen Studio. (Opens March 7, 8, 9) Then there’s Dan Kluger with Greywind, a complex near Hudson Yards that has a restaurant, a bar called Spygold and a bakery that becomes the Chef’s Counter three evenings a month. “I need to be there, but I don’t want to take on too much,” Mr. Kluger said. “The space is also used for private events so I can’t overcommit.” The counter has seats for eight people and offers about six courses with various themes, changing each month, with vegetables and proteins in tandem, $185 at 5:45 and 8:15 p.m. Last week’s menu included leek terrine with potato soup and trout roe, and chicken “oyster” with oyster mushrooms.

0,Songs by the Indigo Girls soundtrack a musical romance.,"There’s nostalgic art. Then there’s art that seems like somebody thawed it after 30 frozen years. “Glitter & Doom” doesn’t yearn for some older time. It’s pure time-warp: a gay musical-love-dramedy that could’ve screened all summer at the old Philadelphia art house where I used to work, plunked amid the queer independent-filmmaking bonanza that helped make the early-to-mid-1990s seem like every gay thing was possible. The movie’s got an earnest, amateurish case of the feel-good gosh-gollies that would have made sense playing down the hall from movies as different (although not that different) as “Go Fish” and “Wigstock,” “Zero Patience” and “The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love” and — God help us all — “Claire of the Moon.” The two dozen or so songs in “Glitter & Doom” aren’t new (but aren’t based on Tom Waits’s 15-year-old live album, either). They’re by the Indigo Girls. Many of them are songs the Indigo Girls made a certain kind of popular during the years of that very bonanza. And what the movie does with them is call attention to the emotional mountain range of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray’s songwriting.","‘Glitter & Doom’ Review: As a Vibe, It’s Fun. As a Film?

Last week, City Hall and the Department of Transportation issued new guidelines for Dining Out NYC, its official program, and the largest such program in the country. “It’s been a priority for Mayor Adams from Day 1,” said Ya-Ting Liu, the city’s chief public realm officer. Restaurants and other establishments that serve food can now apply for permits to take part through an official portal online. Those that are approved and pay a fee for a four-year license ($1,050) for either a roadbed or sidewalk enclosure have 30 days to remove their temporary structures or outfit them to comply with the city’s rules. The authorized structures can remain in place from April through Nov. 29. Restaurants without approval will have to remove their sheds by Aug. 3; those with a pending application will have until Nov. 1. The city has approved four prototypes designed by WXY Studio to eliminate many of the problems with existing makeshift sheds and to adapt to various roadway and sidewalk configurations. They are being built by SITU, a fabrication company, and are already in place at several restaurants. They are not heated and will supposedly be rat-proof; some models are equipped with solar panels. At Bodrum, on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, Huseyin Ozer, an owner, said the 40-foot unit in the roadway outside his restaurant had planters, could be customized with signage, will allow for 16 seats and is easy to disassemble. Hinged floor panels lift to allow for cleaning. Full compliance citywide is expected when the season reopens in April 2025.",NYC Restaurant Sheds Are Here to Stay.

0,The Louis Vuitton men’s creative director collaborated with the rapper to design a golf bag in the spirit of the brand’s 1930s Keepall.,"THOUGH LOUIS VUITTON’S name is now synonymous with luxury fashion, his beginnings were remarkably humble: The designer was raised by his father, a farmer, and his mother, a milliner, in the rural town of Anchay in eastern France. In 1835, a 14-year-old Vuitton embarked — by foot — on a 280-mile, two-year pilgrimage to Paris, where he spent nearly two decades mastering the art of box making under the tutelage of a prominent malletier. Following his appointment as the official trunk maker for Napoleon III’s wife, Eugénie de Montijo, Vuitton opened his first luggage shop in 1854 near Place Vendôme, where he sold leather travel goods and canvas steamer trunks. Vuitton’s business was strong enough that in 1888, his only son, Georges, trademarked his now-signature checkerboard Damier print. The company’s steamer bag, which was intended to contain laundry on trans-Atlantic voyages, debuted in 1901; in the 1930s, the brand released the Keepall, a foldable tote, originally made from cotton canvas, that was small enough to be tucked into larger suitcases.","Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator Remix a Classic Tote","Fashion and Apparel;Golf;Luggage and Packing;Williams, Pharrell;Tyler, the Creator;Louis Vuitton",2024-03-12,article,T Magazine,News

We were given hotel vouchers and told we would be rebooked for the next day. Checkout time came and went without a word, so we went to the airport and were told to call Air Canada customer service. An agent booked us a flight for that evening, and we printed out boarding passes at an airport kiosk. But when we tried to board, we were told the boarding passes were invalid. Eventually, we were offered two options for the next day: Fly to Dublin via Newark, or return to Minneapolis. We cut our losses and went home after staying the night in Toronto at a hotel. But United refunded us only $1,087, barely half of what we paid. Air Canada did reimburse us for the second hotel and other expenses, but we believe the airlines owe us not only a full refund, but also 400 Canadian each ($295 apiece) under Canadian law for denied boarding.
