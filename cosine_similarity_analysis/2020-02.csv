Like this one right here.” He’s talking to Allegra Dill (Rosario Dawson), a powerful government staffer who has returned to her fictional, very surreal Texas hometown to investigate her sister’s death. (The sister was blown up by a car bomb.) The killing is at the center of the series, but its heart may lie elsewhere: Andy Greenwald, a former TV critic who wrote the show (it’s based on the Ross Thomas novel of the same name), said in an interview with The New York Times last year that he was influenced by shows like “Twin Peaks” and “Lost.” “They all had a community of characters who you wanted to spend time with and who you’d get excited about whenever they appeared onscreen,” he said. “‘Who did it?’ is kind of the most boring question you can ask.

0,The comedian Conner O’Malley indicts the greed that built Manhattan’s $25 billion corporate fantasia.,"How does corporate capitalism imagine the human soul? As a nuisance? An opportunity? Collateral damage? A blob of molten plastic to be injected into a minion-­shaped mold? One of the funniest answers to this question comes from the comedian Conner O’Malley, who has built a career playacting the way consumerism warps our spirits. Out on the street, he has recorded dozens of videos in which he plays, basically, capitalism’s hype man — a loudmouthed white dude-bro who is perpetually awed by advertising and luxury goods. He will rush up to anyone who looks rich — men in suits, men driving ostentatious cars — and slather them with over-­the-­top compliments that lean heavily on the word “pimp.” “Oh, hell yeah, pimp!” he shouts into a convertible. When a Hummer stops near him, O’Malley rushes toward its open window: “Man, you’re a job creator, you’re a pimp, you’re an angel, and I love you forever!” His brain seems full of targeted ads. He accosts a businessman on a cellphone: “Dude, what’s up? Maxim Magazine, am I right?” Sometimes O’Malley’s circuitry seems to misfire, but there is no time to stop and think — he will stand in front of a Mustang and chant: “Steroids! Steroids!

0,A new psychological thriller is available on Netflix. And an Octavia Spencer horror film is on HBO.,"HORSE GIRL Stream on Netflix. Alison Brie — who co-wrote this film with its director, Jeff Baena — plays Sarah, an unassuming and socially awkward arts-and-crafts store employee who doesn’t quite fit in with her Zumba classmates or her roommate. Despite this, she finds comfort in her favorite TV show, “Purgatory,” and in visiting a horse she used to own — both of which seem to protect her from the world’s harsh realities, including her mother’s death and her grandmother’s psychosis. Then, Sarah begins to spiral. In what is a clear mental health decline, Sarah finds herself entangled in a web of amnesia, hallucinations and supernatural experiences. “It would be tactful, at this point, for ‘Horse Girl’ to show how Sarah’s hallucinations are causing her suffering; instead, it indulges them,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review for The New York Times. She added, “The more time we spend inside her visions, the more we are invited to enable her, to shrug off our worry in favor of an absorbing paranormal mystery.”",What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Horse Girl’ and ‘Ma’,Television;Movies;Horse Girl (Movie);Ma (2019) (Movie),2020-02-08,article,Arts,News

0,Slanted Door sauces from the chef Charles Phan are designed to amp up the flavor in stir-fries and slow simmers.,"Premade simmer sauces have become a big thing for shortcutting Indian cooking at home. Now, Charles Phan, the founder and chef at the Slanted Door restaurant in San Francisco, has taken the same approach to Vietnamese fare. He has introduced four braising sauces, two for quick stir-fries and two for slower simmers; each comes with a simple recipe based on one of the restaurant’s dishes, usually using at least half the jar of sauce. For many seasoning purposes, I liked the nubbly, spicy-sweet chile caramel sauce, recommended for a shrimp stir-fry, but superb with eggplant, chicken or pork belly. The Claypot Chicken quick-braising sauce and Lo Soi Pork sauce for a slow braise were dark, fairly thin and spicy. The ruddy, viscous Vietnamese French braising sauce was quite sweet and to me, less appealing than the others.",Shortcuts to a Vietnamese Dinner,"Sauces;Slanted Door, The (San Francisco, Calif, Restaurant);Phan, Charles;Williams-Sonoma Inc;Cooking and Cookbooks;San Francisco (Calif);Vietnamese Food (Cuisine)",2020-02-10,article,Food,News

0,"An excerpt from “Something That May Shock and Discredit You,” by Daniel Mallory Ortberg","One generally grows up thinking about the Rapture a great deal or not at all. Most don’t, I think, but among those who did, there’s always the question of how, if at all, to bring up the subject in mixed company, whether in the hopes of eliciting either laughter or shock, followed by sexual intrigue mixed with pity. It’s easy enough to sell out an evangelical Christian childhood, and plenty of other pens have been given over to the subject of whether it’s a good idea to raise children in the expectation of being swept up by the Raisin Bran scoop of heaven; I have no wish to dwell on the question of whether I ought to have been taught about the Rapture. No one consulted me beforehand, and I can’t see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs – it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talk’s cover of “I Wish We’d All Been Ready” sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood.","‘Something That May Shock and Discredit You,’ by Daniel Mallory Ortberg: An Excerpt",,2020-02-11,article,Books,Review

0,"At the Schindler House, a celebration of art, design and fermentation.","In food, fermentation — the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates — is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December’s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city’s diversity of dwellers that he’d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier’s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book “Critical Booch.”)","In Los Angeles, a Historic Home Becomes an Experimental Kitchen","Parties (Social);Art;Friedman Benda Gallery;Ogboh, Emeka (1977- );Highland Park (Los Angeles, Calif)",2020-02-11,article,T Magazine,News

0,Lulu Wang’s indie hit is streaming on Amazon. And a new nature series debuts on the Smithsonian Channel.,"THE FAREWELL (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wang’s own life (or, as the film puts it, “based on an actual lie”), “The Farewell” casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film “has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Farewell’ and ‘Big Cat Country’,Television;Movies,2020-02-12,article,Arts,News

As the Met begins renovations of its Rockefeller Wing, the Caribbean offers its curators a priceless model of how to think about world cultures: never “pure” but in constant motion and constant contact, diffracted across time and oceans.

As detailed in Nadel’s afterword, Whitney was born in 1918, illustrated and invented assorted superheroes (including the Flash and his own, absurd Herbie Popnecker) in his 20s, and served in the Army during World War II. He found later happiness in his 1958 marriage, presumably inspiring the delirious, daftly satisfying romance comics of the early 1960s. Anne Whitney’s death in 1970 precipitated his end: He died five years later in a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx.

Settled into the hollowed ground beneath the dome, the interiors were cool and dim, a reprieve from the forest’s hostility. “These shelters don’t get recognition for being ‘green’ or ‘eco-friendly,’” says the 50-year-old architect José Cubilla, who’s based in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, a slow-paced riverside city built at the point where the Chaco in the west meets the iridescent meadows and forests that unfurl across the country’s east. “But this is what interests me: obvious things, obvious solutions, simple materials.”","Paraguay’s Response to Modernist Architecture?

We purposefully raised Cody Roman and his sister, Jazz, in Alaska, exposing them both to natural history travel and wilderness experiences around the world. When he was six, Cody Roman and I hiked alone across sixty miles of an empty Aleutian island. When he was nine, we made a family trip to a remote national park in Indonesian Borneo, a life-changing experience in an amazing tropical rainforest. While activities like wilderness trips and travel in the developing world set him apart from many kids, Cody Roman played with Legos and video games, listened to indie rock, read Harry Potter, and attended public school as a normal kid from a close-knit family brought closer by nature and adventure. As a professional scientist and explorer, I included him in science and explorations as my favored and willing partner in both.","‘The Adventurer’s Son,’ by Roman Dial: An Excerpt",,2020-02-18,article,Books,Review

Cynics speculated that, with sparkly costumes and three acts titled “Emeralds,” “Rubies” and “Diamonds,” he was trying to attract a glitzier crowd for the relatively proletarian dance company. But he insisted his inspiration came from the gems in the Fifth Avenue windows of Van Cleef & Arpels, the Parisian jeweler run by Claude Arpels. Claude’s uncle, Louis, had been the first Arpels to recognize the elegant symbiosis between gems and the ballet, commissioning the now 124-year-old maison’s signature ballerina clips in the 1940s. Van Cleef & Arpels has continued to reference dance throughout its history, most recently with these earrings made in the dangling rounded-pendant balletti style, inspired by the jewel-toned ball gowns worn by women during the Italian Renaissance. While both pairs feature diamonds and pearls, one suggests spring, with a confection of rubies and pink sapphires, and the other gestures toward fall, with emeralds, yellow sapphires and black spinels. Both dance and spin weightlessly in the light, alive with effervescent grace.

What happened is simple enough: In the Minnesota woods in the summer of 1861, Lindbergh’s grandfather, a recent immigrant from Sweden, got his arm caught in a sawmill. The wound was horrific; the man’s beating heart was visible through the hole in his side. He was expected to die. But he refused.

Through the years, the 73-year-old fashion designer has collected talismans of all kinds. Some she’s found on her travels for her brand — which has grown, since her iconic 1974 silk jersey wrap dress was introduced, to include 85 stores on four continents — others were given to her by friends or family. “Their power is in the energy of the person who gives them to you, or the place where they came from,” says von Furstenberg, who was born and raised in Belgium. The designer’s company bears the surname of her first husband, the German prince Egon von Furstenberg, with whom she had two children: a son, Alexander, and daughter, Tatiana. Her granddaughter Talita now designs TVF, the brand’s more youthful line, which launched last April.

0,"In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the Civil War and the precarious state of America through the president’s 1865 inaugural speech.","Less than two weeks after delivering his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln wrote that he expected the speech to “wear as well as — perhaps better than — any thing I have produced.” But, he added, “I believe it is not immediately popular.” He was right on both counts. The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day. Below, Achorn discusses the hostility toward the president, the diaries of Southern women, how Stanley Kubrick is like Lincoln and more.",24 Tense Hours in Abraham Lincoln’s Life,"Lincoln, Abraham;Books and Literature;Civil War (US) (1861-65);Writing and Writers;United States;Achorn, Edward;Every Drop of Blood: The Momentous Second Inauguration of Abraham Lincoln (Book)",2020-02-23,article,Books,News

0,The designers behind Proenza Schouler reimagined Birkenstock’s classic two-strap Arizona and three-strap Milano sandals.,"Since founding Proenza Schouler in 2002, the designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez have largely avoided collaborations with other companies. “They became such a thing everyone did,” says Hernandez, “and we kind of like to do the opposite.” That meant focusing on refining their own aesthetic language and producing elegant clothes that look the way a good idea feels: pleasurably counterintuitive, accessible yet complex, at once inevitable and original. Often the pair achieves this sort of tension by balancing the conceptual with the casual. It’s no surprise, then, that when they did decide to collaborate, it was with Birkenstock, the nearly 250-year-old German shoe company whose legions of fans include many a fashion person, perhaps because the iconic chunky sandals can always be relied upon to offset a look that threatens to come off as too dressed.","The Shoes Beloved by Deadheads and Skaters, Updated for the Fashion Set","Shoes and Boots;Fashion and Apparel;Birkenstock Footprint Sandals;Proenza Schouler;Hernandez, Lazaro;McCollough, Jack",2020-02-23,article,T Magazine,News

0,A cookbook from the chef Pierre Thiam offers a guide to making this African grain.,"Is fonio the new quinoa? This African grain, native to the regions just south of the Sahara, has been given that label. It has a lot going for it, as Pierre Thiam, a New York chef from Senegal, explains in his elegant cookbook. Fonio is easy and fast to grow. It’s also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africa’s agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesn’t clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa. I have served it topped with a ragout of mushrooms and used it in meatloaf. But first you need to buy it: There’s a useful list of sources in the book.",How to Serve Fonio,"Grain;Thiam, Pierre;AFRICA;The Fonio Cookbook: An Ancient Grain Rediscovered (Book);Cooking and Cookbooks",2020-02-24,article,Food,News

The new big-screen adaptation of Jack London’s “The Call of the Wild” shares an actor with “War for the Planet of the Apes,” but you won’t see his face in either movie: He’s Terry Notary, a motion-capture performer whose movements provided the basis for the digital dog that stars opposite Harrison Ford in “The Call of the Wild,” and who played one of Andy Serkis’s chimpanzee companions in the “Planet of the Apes” movies of the 2010s. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) “The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up,” A.O.

By 16, Sialelli was interning at Opéra de Marseille’s costume department, where he worked alongside members of the fashion designer Christian Lacroix’s team. That apprenticeship led to another at Lacroix’s headquarters in Paris, during which time Sialelli studied fashion at Studio Berçot. After graduating in 2010, he spent four years working on Nicolas Ghesquière’s and Alexander Wang’s design teams at Balenciaga before moving to Acne Studios, Paco Rabanne and, finally, Loewe, where he led men’s wear under the creative director Jonathan Anderson until late 2018.

The film ultimately “becomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Greenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes — those notorious emblems of Marcos’s excess — but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury,” Dargis wrote. “It’s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘The Kingmaker’ and ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’,Television;Movies,2020-02-28,article,Arts,News
