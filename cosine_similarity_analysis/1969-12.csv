0,"Lumpy history, bearskin to battlefield and back.","CLIVE DONNER'S ""Alfred the Great,"" the saga of the ninth-century king of Wessex who made the first attempts to unite England, is not what the authors of ""1066 and All That"" might have described as a Good Thing, although it does have a few good things in it. The film, which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, often suggests the feeling of a remote, barbaric time and a cold, damp place. The landscapes look somehow desolate, even when in full leaf. The skies are mostly overcast, as if threatening such unnatural phenomena as thunderstorms in winter. The rituals are primitive and the housing is rude.However, as soon as somebody opens his mouth ""Your will says 'no' to me—your body 'yes'""), you're aware you're lost in an exotic movie genre that has proved to be the undoing of almost every creditable director in the last 40 years, with the possible exceptions of Cecil B. DeMille and Sergei Eisenstein.Unlike DeMille, Donner has no genius for transforming epic narratives into exalted comic strips, and unlike Eisenstein, he is no master of montage. Donner, the director of two decently contemporary comedies (""Nothing but the Best,"" ""What's New Pussycat?"") and his screenwriters, Ken Taylor and James R. Webb, have visualized the story of Alfred as a sort of Old-English western in which, stranger still, a devoutly Christian Freud confronts the druid mentality.Apparently finding the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle too skimpy for their needs, Donner and his associates have used an unnamed novel by Elenor Shipley Duckett as their principal text. Of equal importance to the surface conflicts—the attempts to drive out the pagan Danes—are the battles of the pious, guilt-ridden Alfred to overcome his own lusty nature. ""The demons are within ourselves; we must learn to live with them,"" he tells his young son at one point. Alfred's queen explains to her Danish captor that Alfred ""hates me because he loves me,"" after which she promptly makes herself available on a bearskin.Unfortunately, the film is effective neither on bearskin nor battlefield, neither as conjecture nor as history. Donner hasn't staged his battles as much as he has choreographed them — with all of the unlikely precision of Rockettes routines. The dialogue is of the sort expected from movie characters who wassail too much from hollowed steer horns (""Look you, lady, the poet Ovid was no fool!"") and stuffed with subsidiary information not easily dramatized. Thus are covered Alfred's intellectual achievements: ""We need a book in our own Saxon tongue.""David Hemmings, who plays Alfred, has rather poppy eyes and even reads some lines as Bette Davis might (""Let/him/be/flogged!""). Prunella Ransome, a lovely, freckled girl, is his unhappy, hot-blooded queen, and Michael Yorke is Guthrun, the Danish King.

But it lingers on in the movies, with shimmery violins and filtered lenses, the cinema substitute for those atmospheric Ladies' Home Journal illustrations that eased me and so many of the boys I went to school with into the dreamier reaches of early adolescence. Among such movies, Desmond Davis's ""A Nice Girl Like Me"" merits some kind of notice for its absolute preference for mood over matter and for its willingness to translate even the pains of childbirth into the stock poetry of trembling treetops and rustling leaves.What I mean is that out of any five shots four will decorate and only one will help tell the story. So we have flowers and branches, misty mornings and rainy afternoons, the seasons (autumn more than anything else: a leaf, sunlight dappled or raindrop speckled, floating delicately in a puddle) and the cities. There are the Utrillo streets of Paris, the Canaletto canals of Venice, and over London glows a Turner sky. Everything looks like somebody else's work of art, or, at the very least, a 50-cent greeting card. And much of it is photographed according to that esthetic law that dictates that the camera should aim always for the light of the sun—preferably the setting sun.Through it all swirls Candida (Barbara Ferris, who had her troubles last year with Oscar Werner in ""Interlude""), an optimistic orphan with a lust for life, an unearned little income, a shipshape London row house on the river and a crusty caretaker named Savage (Harry Andrews). Candida isn't much for sex but she's big on babies, and she conceives a couple (beside the Seine, overlooking the Grand Canal—where else?) and adopts one, while Savage handles the brood and she looks for marriage without pregnancy instead of the other way around. She almost makes it with the foreign service (James Villiers), but knows it isn't Real, and on the banks of the Thames she comes to her senses—and to the arms of Savage, who, she realizes, can be maid and mother and lover, too—a lost girl's dream.Barbara Ferris is a strong-featured girl with an odd facial resemblance to Noël Coward. Despite her winsome smile, flaxen hair and peaches-and-cream complexion, she plays innocence as if it were an allegory of experience—and lines of calculation enmesh the cornflowers. But for the perhaps 10 minutes James Villiers is on the screen, as a bungling bachelor diplomat, everything wonderfully changes. In the sensitive assurance of his performance, the movie becomes tougher, sadder, funnier, and even Miss Ferris glows within the pathos of her portrayal.""A Nice Girl Like Me"" is playing at neighborhood theaters on a double bill with Henri-Georges Clouzot's sadomasochist sex fantasy, ""La Prisonniere"" — which makes the strangest family entertainment package of the year.","THE woman's story may be a declining form even for the magazines that still publish it.

0,"THE first few minutes of ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" are a practically perfect screen equivalent to the quiet joys to be found in almost any of Charles M. Schuiz's ""Peanuts"" comic strips. Charlie, Lucy and Linus are lying on their backs on a small green lump of a hill, watching the clouds roll by, Lucy, uncharacteristically reflective, says the clouds look like great wads of cotton. Linus sees the stoning of Stephen, ""with the Apostle Paul down there on the right,"" as well as the profile of Thomas Eakins, ""the great 19th-century American portrait painter and sculptor."" All Charlie Brown can see are some horsies and duckies.Charlie Brown is not only a loser and a mess (Lucy points out that his nose, stomach and even his toes are fat), but also a born square. Nevertheless, he and the other members of the ""Peanuts"" commune are very pleasant company for most of the 85 minutes of their first theatrical feature. The film opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall with the hall's annual Christmas stage show.I do have some reservations about the film, but it's difficult—perhaps impossible—to be anything except benign towards a G - rated, animated movie that manages to include references to St. Stephen, Thomas Eakins, Harpers Ferry, baseball, contemporary morality (as it relates to Charlie Brown's use of his ""bean ball""), conservation and kite flying. It's quite apparent that Schulz himself wrote the screenplay, which was directed by Bill Melendez and produced by Lee Mendelson.The three have been collaborating successfully for some time now on the Charlie Brown television specials, whose 30-minute formats may be about as long as any four-panel comic strip can be genially stretched.As if to attain the required running time, "" A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" sticks a number of rather weak ""specialties"" into what looks like material that should fill no more than a half dozen daily strips. However, just as we endure Harpo Marx plucking some chestnut from his harp (knowing always that pandemonium must follow), we can sit patiently as Charlie Brown's friend Schroeder gives us a fast version of the Pathétique Sonata, accompanied by some totally un-Charlie Brown visual effects that suggest a kind of nightmare of Peter Max, Dufy and Rouault.With somewhat better effect, Melendez employs the split screen; he pictures the words Charlie Brown must spell at the climactic spelling bee (Charlie Brown fails, as Snoopy groans, on the word ""beagle""), and he turns the screen into the op patterns of the American flag when ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is played to estart another disastrous Charlie Brown baseball season.For the most part, Melendez is satisfied to re-create with fidelity Schulz's own style, which is an apotheosis of the sort of cartooning that I associate with the correspondence courses once advertized in the back of Boy's Life. A house is a house, a tree is a tree—which is as it should be in the world of Charlie Brown.The pleasures of the film are the delicate, unspectacular ones of the original comic strip: Snoppy's fantasizing that his dog house is a Sopwith Camel, Linus's going to pieces when he loses his blanket (his ""spiritual tourniquet""), or Charlie Brown's irritation when he finds the pitcher's mound covered by dandelions (Lucy tells him he looks cute standing there, which doesn't help). There is also something nice about Charlie Brown's stoicism in the face of continual defeat. ""The world has not come to an end,"" Linus reminds him after he loses the spelling bee, and one knows that it never will for Charlie Brown.The only really dreadful contribution to the film is that of Rod McKuen, whose three songs (including one called ""Failure Face"") can barely be endured. ""Charlie has a way,"" McKuen sings over the opening credits, ""of picking up the day/Just by walking in a room."" In addition to anything else you might say about the lyrics, they aren't even true.

0,"AGNES VARDA'S ""Les Créatures,"" at the New Yorker Theater, plays with science fiction but intends allegory, and ultimately slights both genres in favor of sometimes handsome, sometimes fancy, stylistics. Those who have seen ""Cléo From 5 to 7"" and ""Le Bonheur"" will recall that Miss Varda is much attracted to the ultimate themes of death and birth in ""Les Créatures"" she has both, and various agents of super-nature, and the time and the tides as well—but though cooking a stew with heavy ingredients, she produced mostly froth, and a little steam.The story involves a writer (Michel Piccoli), who with his beautiful, pregnant young wife (Catherine Deneuve), takes an island house where he plans to write a novel. An automobile accident has shocked her into speechlessness and left him with one of those scars up the forehead that usually indicates control by The Others. The writer actually is not controlled, though it turns out that almost everybody else in the community is—by a wicked old man who lives in a tower and encourages evil impulses by means of two TV screens, some iron disks, a few flashing lights, a lot of 1930's radio equipment, and a magical chess board with people as chessmen.After several adventures and some subplots, the writer to the dark tower comes, and he settles down to a game of dice and destinies, with his own ""confidence in humanity"" against the ""wicked chances"" on the side of the old man. Another four subplots are introduced via the TV screens, the old man almost wins, but the writer resorts to blows, smashes the equipment, and in the struggle the old man falls to his death.Then love conquers all. The survivors of the seven subplots make happy arrangements — for example, the statuesque hotel keeper (Eva Dahlbeck) gives up mistressing for the town doctor and begins with an underage busboy. The writer almost completes his novel. The wife gets her voice back, pronounces her husband's name (""Edgar""), and has her baby — a bawling creature who at the end fills up the screen precisely to balance (and somewhat to resemble) a crab creature that fills it at the beginning.Miss Varda directs a fine cast, including Catherine Deneuve at her most beautiful in white flounces and Grecian hairdos, and she sets a handsome scene. But her natural images and mystical symbols suggest the tawdry or the trivial, and no matter what the profundities at hand, she seems always to be scratching surfaces.When I first saw ""Les Créatures,"" at the 1966 New York Film Festival, I hated it as mere fraud and fashion. But it looks a lot better, or at least less bad, to me now. In every Agnès Varda entersprise there are so many lovely people, there is so much mouth-watering décor and such heedless gusto in juggling life's most potent moments, that I am inclined slightly to forgive the large embarrassments for the small favors. If you could really photograph the secrets of the universe and publish them in a fashion magazine, Miss Varda would be a great artist. But as it is, she rates at least an appreciative footnote in the history of taste.","AGNES VARDA'S ""Les Créatures,"" at the New Yorker Theater, plays with science fiction but intends allegory, and ultimately slights both genres in favor of sometimes handsome, sometimes fancy, stylistics.

0,Nice background of 1920's Americana. Not bad but could have been better.,"PETER TEWKSBURY'S ""The Trouble With Girls"" is a charming though ineptly titled comedy with one fortunate murder, several pleasant songs, Elvis Presley, and a huge cast all of whom, down to the last extra, seem willing to act their fool heads off. The plot, which hinges on what a small-town hard-luck woman (Sheree North) rightly does to a lecherous druggist (Dabney Coleman), deserves little attention. But the situation, a traveling chautauqua making a small-town stand in the mid-1920's, deserves a lot of attention—which it gets in a film that succeeds so amiably in its parts that the relative weakness of the whole doesn't matter too desperately.Tewksbury began directing features with the very durable comedy ""Sunday in New York"" (1964), and he has continued making good, if not especially memorable movies since. ""The Trouble With Girls"" is more a director's movie than it is, say, a vehicle for Elvis Presley, but it suggests a director more at home with intelligent observation than with intense vision, a director whose film personality is in part a function of his sense of comic pacing.The evocation of 1920's Americana is exceptionally even-handed, detailed, affectionate without sentimentality, funny without condescension.A package of terrific foil-wrapped fireworks, spiffy slang, a talent competition in which six boys play ""America"" in unison on kazoos, a female English Channel swimmer's lecture-demonstration showing her audience how to smear axle grease as body protection ""for your longer dips"" — so many mementos that serve to enliven the present as much as they recall the past. ""The Trouble With Girls"" is an immensely active film that seems virtually to live within the styles and language of its period.The whole cast is so attractive that even the unpleasant characters (Dabney Coleman and Med Flory) please so far as their roles allow. Marlyn Mason as the not-quite-romantic lead seems to me the best of the women, an excellent comedienne in a film that demands performance more than presence from its actors. Elvis Presley performs too, with a reasonably developed characterization as the chautauqua company manager, and he sings very well. Also singing are several kids, two male quartets, a fine country trio identified on the cast list as The Farmhands, and, brightly, the Pacific Palisades High School Madrigal Singers.""The Trouble With Girls"" is playing at neighborhood theaters as second feature to ""Fiareup."" I saw it at the New Amsterdam on 42d Street, where they were charging less than a dollar yesterday morning and the projection was excellent.",' Trouble With Girls',"MOTION PICTURES;Trouble With Girls, The (Movie)",1969-12-11,article,Archives,Review

0,Depression-era dance marathon. Bleakly powerful. Young's Oscar.,"""CAN I get you something for your feet?"" the nurse at the dance marathon asks Gloria (Jane Fonda) who, after approximately 700 hours of continuous dancing, looks like an exhausted Little Orphan Annie. Gloria asks in return: ""How about a saw?"" And, for a brief moment you can almost see Gloria, propped up on a grimy cot during her 10-minute break, purposefully dismembering her feet as an offscreen band plays something cheerful like ""Japanese Sandman.""Gloria, a Typhoid Mary of existential despair, is the terrified and terrifying heroine of Sydney Pollack's ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", the film adaptation of Horace McCoy's Depression novel that opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater. The movie is far from being perfect, but it is so disturbing in such important ways that I won't forget it very easily, which is more than can be said of much better, more consistent films.McCoy's novel, sometimes called ""a minor classic"" (a patronizing way of saying that something's good but not great), was written and published in its own time (1935). It's a spare, bleak parable about American life, which McCoy pictured as a Los Angeles dance marathon in the early thirties.The setting is a shabby ballroom on an amusement pier at the edge of the Pacific. The narrator, Robert Syverton, is a gentle, passive nonentity who, as he is tried for Gloria's murder and then as he awaits execution, recalls the events leading up to the murder. When asked why he did it, he answers simply: ""She asked me to,"" adding: ""They shoot horses, don't they?"" Robert Syverton is the sort of character who, 15 years later, might have sought his fate in an exotic North Africa created by Paul Bowles.There is, however, nothing exotic about McCoy's novel, which, although lean, is full of the kind of apocalyptic detail that both he and Nathanael West saw in life as lived on the Hollywood fringe.Gloria, an Angel of Death who wears ankle socks and favors a marcel permanent wave, is too old, too bitter and too gross even to have gotten registered by Central Casting. Robert, who has fantasies of being a great director like von Sternberg and Mamoulian and Vidor, has only played a few ""atmosphere bits."" In desperation they enter the dance marathon, set, symbolically, at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, the last, impenetrable frontier.Without actually changing the structure of the novel, told in flashbacks, the movie takes as its principal setting the marathon itself, and flashes forward to the trial in quick, subliminal, highly stylized cuts. Pollack, and his screenwriters, James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, have, necessarily, taken liberties in fleshing out a movie story. They have added characters, some of which like Red Buttons (as an over-age marathon contestant) and Susannah York (as a would-be Jean Harlow with delusions of grandeur) have their prototypes in the sort of nineteen-thirty B-picture microcosms set on submarines or in sorority houses.Characters who existed in the book as little more than names have been given histories. Rocky, an aging, tank-town Ben Bernie (beautifully played by a no-longer young Gig Young who is the marathon's emcee, now has as much of a past (his father was a faithhealer) as either Gloria or Robert (Michael Sarrazin) ties. The effect of this is to blunt the edge of—and to overstate—the novel's single-minded nightmare-like qualities.Even with all of the quite marvelous period touches—the songs, the settings, the costumes and the jargon—the movie always looks like a 1969 recapitulation of another time and place. The book, conceived as a contemporary tale, was not so encumbered with artifacts.Nevertheless, the movie is by far the best thing that Pollack has ever directed (with the possible exception of ""The Scalphunters""). While the cameras remain, as if they had been sentenced, within the ballroom, picking up the details of the increasing despair of the dancers, the movie becomes an epic of exhaustion and futility. The circular patterns of the dancers, the movement that leads nowhere, are the metaphors of the movie.All of the performances are fine—Miss Fonda, Sarrazin, Young, Miss York and Bonnie Bedelia (as a little Okie girl who carries on in the seventh month of pregnancy). There are some small anachronisms, including a new Johnny Green song that recalls the 1940's or 1950's, instead of the 1930's. These are not really important, however.The most disquieting thing is the movie's stated assumption that people are horses (I don't even think horses should be people, as in ""Black Beauty""), an assumption that is somehow denied by the physical opulence (which, in some curious way, represents a kind of optimism) of the production itself.",Pollack's 'They Shoot Horses' Opens at the Fine Arts:Theme Based on Novel by Horace McCoy,"MOTION PICTURES;They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

0,The day after a one-night stand. Much 60's-style ado about nothing.,"""JOHN AND MARY"" stars Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow as the sort of unattached New Yorkers who frequent singles bars, decorate their walls with pop-posters, stand in line outside the Sutton Theater, possess paperback books of poetry (probably unread), and, in general, find themselves full of muted desperation, imprisoned by the new First Avenue morality that has supposedly liberated them.The film, which opened yesterday at the Sutton, seems quite right on its outside. It was shot in Manhattan (at Friday's, on Riverside Drive, in Murray Hill) and it is paced by the latest cinematic clichés — sudden cuts to flashbacks and fantasies, usually designed as comic punctuation marks to present pretensions. If you look at it closely, however, you see the structure of an old Fred MacMurray-Claudette Colbert comedy, run backward.A young man (John) and a young woman (Mary) meet late on a Friday night at Friday's. They go to bed as strangers and then spend the next 24 hours rattling around John's apartment, alternately insulting each other and making up, trying to find out if they're fond of each other.Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert never went to bed together (Heaven and the late Eric Johnston know!) until they were properly married. But, as are John and Mary, they were symbols of an urban culture (made mythic by the stars' pretenses) who acted out the classic mating ritual of pursuit, rebuff, misunderstanding and reconciliation. There is nothing wrong with the idea of ""John and Mary,"" just with its execution.John Mortimer's screenplay is short-focused, its action confined mostly to John's apartment where John and Mary eat, talk and lie about with such dreary verisimilitude that you eventually find yourself less interested in John and Mary than in the settings, clothes and objects that surround them.I was struck (as I'm sure I was meant to be) by a pan shot across John's bedroom that revealed Norman Mailer's ""Miami and the Siege of Chicago"" standing next to Tom Wolfe's ""The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test."" In another scene you see his linen closet stacked with bath-towels, which says more about the character of a well-organized, slightly prim bachelor than anything in the dialogue. He's obviously the sort of man who plans ahead, who gets to the laundry before it closes.Hoffman, who is so fine in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" is here upstaged by interior scenery. He gives a performance by combining his mannerisms, including the smile turned tentatively on and off like a light bulb and the stooped strut of an over-age Holden Caulfield. Miss Farrow is also meant to be appealing, but the role is so skimpily written that no amount of mumbling and pausing at odd points in the middle of a sentence can give it much life. What emerges is a character composed partly of the weird waif of ""Secret Ceremony,"" partly of the haunted mother of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" masquerading as an ordinary, almost slovenly girl whose brown jumper dress would probably be covered with cat hairs, if she had a cat.In the supporting cast are Sunny Griffin, as a shrill, high fashion model who was formerly John's mistress, and Michael Tolan, as a married member of Congress with whom Mary had an unhappy affair. They are characters who would be much more comfortable in the pseudo-sophisticated world of MacMurray and Colbert than in the neo-realistic one of Hoffman and Farrow.""John and Mary"" is the work of Peter Yates (""Robbery,"" Bullitt""), who seems most at ease with firm of broadly choreographed movement and suspense. This one has little suspense and no movement, except for that of the camera in confined spaces.The film is not without relevance. People do flop into bed together these days without much preliminary investigation, often (like John and Mary) having exchanged vague opinions on Italian movies but not their own names. Social accuracy, however, can contribute to—but not substitute for—human comedy.",Screen: 'John and Mary' at the Sutton:A Familiar Love Story Is Told Backward Hoffman-Farrow Team in Constricted Roles,MOTION PICTURES;John and Mary (Movie),1969-12-15,article,Archives,Review

0,"CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S ""The Circus"" opened Jan. 2, 1928, at the Strand Theater. If this review seems a little late, it at least has an occasion to justify it—a new run for ""The Circus,"" which has begun playing at the 72d Street Playhouse.Chaplin has added a soundtrack, no dialogue, but a musical score that he himself composed. Anybody who has seen recent Chaplin movies, especially the miraculous ""A Countess From Hong Kong,"" knows that he writes the loveliest kitsch background music since the Oskar Straus waltzes that graced the great Max Ophuls films of the early 1950's.""The Circus"" discovers Charlie, in the person of the Little Tramp, standing hungry outside a traveling circus, and it leaves him, sitting in the ring, after the circus itself has pulled away. In between, Charlie joins the circus as roustabout, saves it with the humor of his monumental ineptitude, falls in love with the circus owner's daughter (Merna Kennedy), and loses her to the handsome tightrope walker — whose suit he bravely promotes. The theme of unhappy romance is not unusual in the major Chaplin films, though it is treated with less circumstance and much less pathetic detail in ""The Circus"" than in, say, ""The Gold Rush"" or ""City Lights""—both of which enjoy accidental happy endings that are more gracious than gratuitous.The exemplary renunciation at the end of this film essentially begs an appreciation of what the Little Tramp stands for and what, despite his deserts, he is likely to get.But the image of the circus itself, an arena partly intended for comic performance, is a little unusual. Chaplin works very hard not to exploit it.As a circus employe he succeeds at everything except comedy. He services the animals, moves the props; and, even in a pinch, walks the high wire (the film's great climactic routine, and as prodigiously funny as anything in Chaplin), but he never makes it as a clown, and all the laughs are, from Charlie's point of view, unintentional.Even the regular circus clowns are unfunny, which is why Charlie is hired in the first place—to get laughs without meaning to. That group of clowns, seen in medium long shot, tumbling, jumping, running, working like crazy in the ring, but to no avail, are for me the most mysterious and moving image in the film. Everything in Chaplin's circus militates against good times. Acts fail, the owner beats his daughter and denies her food, the property men quit because they are not paid—and the ring itself displays failure, pain and frustration.Charlie succeeds, in effect, by disrupting the circus—by interrupting the acts, exposing the secrets of magician's prop table (another great comic routine), running to escape a normally placid donkey that charges madly every time it sees him. Therefore the circus functions much like any other Chaplin locale that Charlie divides to conquer. But at the same time it is meant to keep much of its traditional sentimental weight and even some of its handy metaphorical significance. ""The Circus"" is very knowledgeable about its world, but I don't think it is very deeply committed to it. At the end, the Little Tramp sits alone in the tentless ring. The circus wagons have all vanished in a cloud of dust—a really speedy desertion. A memento of his beloved lies in the dirt at his feet, and only sky and suburban scrubland surrounds him.A call to emotion is at hand, but at least in me, the response is not forthcoming. We have too often throughout the film, in the spaces between the great set pieces, glimpsed the mind behind the matter, and now we confront not so much the pathos of the situation as the careful promotion of a well-beloved institution.","CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S ""The Circus"" opened Jan. 2, 1928, at the Strand Theater.

0,"IT'S high time that Anthony Quinn played a happy millionaire. He has earned it and so have we.In ""A Dream of Kings,"" the gifted actor is once again a battered giant of a Greek peasant, saddled with more woes than Zorba inherited from Job. The setting of this new drama is the Greek community of Chicago, where a tired, disillusioned man named Matsoukas ekes out a living as a neighborhood marriage counselor.Matsoukas prowls the community, a popular figure who continually spouts the pride of his origin in the old country, his heritage of kings, nobles and giants. He relaxes with his pals at a gambling emporium, weaving home, more in debt than ever, to a long-suffering wife, two young daughters and the dying little son he idolizes. He also shrewdly and tenderly seduces a pretty young widow down the block.Even as he throws it away, Matsoukas's focal dream is money, enough to take the dying child to Greece. And the two of them finally board a plane, after Matsoukas loses his best friend and is almost beaten to death in an alley, through his own stupid connivance.The main trouble with this drawn-out soap opera, which National General Pictures opened yesterday at the Orleans and Cinema II, is the hero, who is also his own worst enemy. He is a commonplace fellow, good-hearted, helpless and basically dull. The keen eyes and strapping physique of Quinn render him as exasperating to us as to his wife, whom Irene Papas understandably plays like a walking blowtorch.Yet there is a feel and precision about the rest of the film, aside from its main concern, that call for a more arresting hero. The evocation of the Greek community, photographed in strong color by Richard H. Kline on exterior location in Chicago, is splendidly alive and vibrant, with firm work by a fine supporting cast.Even with Quinn's Matsoukas as a magnet, Delbert Mann's sensible direction overlooks little in the way of telling detail and bit characterizations. And the scenario, penned by the book's author, Harry Mark Petrakis, and Ian Hunter, includes some effectively natural vignettes, such as the scene when Quinn counsels a stunned mother and her sexually awakened son. And all the scenes with Quinn and his own stricken boy, Radames Pera, are touching.The surprise of the picture is Inger Stevens, who does a beautiful job as the lonely, pent-up widow. Sam Levene's performance, as Quinn's best friend, is all we would expect of this fine actor. Of the others, Val Avery, Peter Mamakos, James Dobson and a score of other faces are sturdy components of the background mosaic. And an old actress named Tamara Daykarhanova is wonderfully sly and comical as Quinn's hated mother-in-law.At one point Quinn is told, ""The gods have chosen you for tragedy."" There is nothing to do but sit there, fidgeting, wondering how long it will take.","IT'S high time that Anthony Quinn played a happy millionaire. He has earned it and so have we.In ""A Dream of Kings,"" the gifted actor is once again a battered giant of a Greek peasant, saddled with more woes than Zorba inherited from Job. The setting of this new drama is the Greek community of Chicago, where a tired, disillusioned man named Matsoukas ekes out a living as a neighborhood marriage counselor.Matsoukas prowls the community, a popular figure who continually spouts the pride of his origin in the old country, his heritage of kings, nobles and giants. He relaxes with his pals at a gambling emporium, weaving home, more in debt than ever, to a long-suffering wife, two young daughters and the dying little son he idolizes. He also shrewdly and tenderly seduces a pretty young widow down the block.Even as he throws it away, Matsoukas's focal dream is money, enough to take the dying child to Greece.

0,"A supposedly ``with-it'' now comedy  and pretty much a flat tire, then and now.","AS a tyro playwright, William Goodhart struck it fairly rich on Broadway four years ago with ""Generation,"" a diverting if not memorable comedy that mined a basically thin vein of subject, the generation gap. It commendably illustrated his talent for fashioning bright, natural, occasionally funny lines and situations, more than a genius for unearthing a provocative theme.Using a slightly altered focus in the film version, exposed yesterday at the Lincoln Art and the Embassy East, he has proved that he can regenerate his antic on screen and again be natural, charming and amusing now and again. The fact is that the plot is essentially meager. It is, nevertheless, the kind of pleasant play-acting that merely touches on important matters while moving quickly to score points with gags and visual effects.Playgoers may recall that Mr. Goodhart's devices were satisfying, and they seem to work better in the expanded reaches of the screen. We still have the story of the advertising executive, who is shocked and confused to discover that his newly married daughter is about to have a child by her Greenwich Village photographer-husband, an anti-Establishment, do-it-yourself type with intentions of being his own obstetrician (via natural childbirth) in the seedy, sprawling loft they call home.Perspiring grandpa-to-be still looms large in the film, but the young lovers are favored by the dialogue, situations and color cameras. It's a logical point of view since they emerge as an attractive, fairly sensible, if offbeat pair. As the long-haired, smiling, genuinely dedicated husband, Pete Duel, a newcome from TV, is a likable rebel, who efficiently practices what he preaches.As his devoted bride, Kim Darby, the appealing youngster of ""True Grit,"" is bright-eyed, pretty and equally self-sufficient and draws sympathy and some chuckles as she good-naturedly practices for the big birth scene while trying to keep peace between the two men she loves in different ways.David Janssen, often a stony-faced performer, is animated, wryly comic and properly worried as the loving father who desperately tries to cope with a bizarre state of affairs. They all have the help of brisk direction by George Schaefer, and scattered zany sight gags such as Mr. Janssen's being, met at Kennedy Airport by a dilapidated, rattling plumber's track driven by his son-in-law, or his perplexed encounter with a hippie group practicing a ""vibrations"" cult in a tinfoil-lined Village pad.Andrew Prine may be a minor figure as a coolly efficient advertising agency publicly chief, but there is Carl Reiner to keep matters livelier. As the successful but down-to-earth obstetrician-pal of the nervous Mr. Janssen, he is ever ready with a flip line of dubious assurance, such as ""that vein in your forehead is pulsing like crazy.""As his close friend, he is there, however, with climactic professional know-how to aid in the breech birth. ""We both respect what you're trying to do,"" Mr. Janssen tells his overwrought son-in-law, who gratefully accepts Mr. Reiner's assistance. And a viewer also has to respect ""Generation""—even if its principals and their goals are somewhat improbable—as a lightweight but cheerful entertainment.",'Generation' Returns in Film Version,MOTION PICTURES;Generation (Movie),1969-12-16,article,Archives,Review

0,"Cub reporter in Chicago, back when. Doesn't click, but they try hard.","BEN HECHT, the late playwright (co-author with Charles MacArthur of ""The Front Page,"" ""Twentieth Century""), novelist (""A Jew in Love""), rococo filmmaker (""The Specter of the Rose"") and raconteur, probably would not recognize himself in Norman Jewison's new film, ""Gaily, Gaily,"" based on Hecht's reminiscences of his days as a cub reporter in Chicago more than 50 years ago.However, if he could accept the film's comic premises — as I can — he would find it a movie of great and exuberant charm, one that pays homage to the classic conventions of American farce by defining them with nostalgia and cinematic wit.The time is 1910. In his tiny bedroom in the family's house in Galena, Ill., 16-year-old Ben Harvey (Beau Bridges) groans in his sleep as silent movies of Little Egypt flicker through his head, interrupted from time to time by the censorious, rotogravure image of President Taft. The next day, as Ben is standing at the top of his gym class's human pyramid (chanting ""A healthy mind/A healthy body/Make money!""), he spies a lady equipped with some truly stunning cleavage. Ben swoons, falls and seems to have been killed.Later, as he lies unconscious on his bed, his family stands around, arguing about what's wrong with him. ""Nothing,"" says the doctor. ""His juices are all jammed up!"" screams his ancient grandmother. A concerned visitor is the lady whose cleavage started it all. She leans over the bed and, surreptitiously, Ben comes to life.Ben Harvey has such a thing about bosoms (including his own and the devil within it) that he runs away to Chicago to avoid disgrace as a sex maniac. As soon as he arrives, he has his pocket picked, finds refuge in a gaudy bordello (he thinks it's a boarding house), becomes a newspaper reporter, gets drunk, gets seduced, hobnobs with murderers and crooked politicians, and, finally, is instrumental in solving a complicated farce involving the possession of a little black book of highly placed names.Jewison, the director of ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and his writer, Abram S. Ginnes, haven't hesitated to recall the memory of the tough-talking, sentimental Hecht, a New York-born Jew reared in Racine, Wis., in the form of a prototype Anglo-Saxon rube of epic naiveté.They've even changed his name, but, I suppose, in some circles even Aaron Slick's name might sound too Jewish. With the exception of the title, a few other character names and the vague outline of two episodes, the screenplay is completely original.However, Jewison and Ginnes have done their work with an obvious awareness of and affection for its farcial conventions (which, of course, when badly used, are clichés).""Gaily, Gaily,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's State 1 and Ciné Theaters, is based on all sorts of questionable premises—that the sight of a female breast will drive a normal man one without a particular fetish) quite insane with lust, that whores have innocent hearts, that crooked politicians are harmless and that harddrinking newspapermen are lovable.Strangely enough, Jewison makes it all work by mixing styles and images that are less reminiscent of Hecht than they are of Twain and Dickens. There are a couple of comparatively grisly comic episodes involving cadavers (and attempts to revive them with a ""resurrection drug"" called Adrenalin). At one point, young Ben even attends his own funeral.Although the period is 1910, there is a distinct Dickensian flavor to the props—nightshirts, candles, carriages and stove-pipe hats—and in the complete acceptance of coincidence. And, if nothing else in the film had moved me, I still would cherish Jewison's careful recollection of old Chicago scenes and his use of the interior of the Dankmar Adler-Louis Sullivan Auditorium Theater, one of this country's most beautiful.He has also gotten an extremely comic performance from Beau Bridges (who is so good he stands in terrible danger of being type-cast), a funny and restrained one from Melina Mercouri as a would-be Everleigh sister, and excellent support from Brian Keith, George Kennedy, Hume Cronyn and Margot Kidder.Throughout ""Gaily, Gaily,"" there is always the awareness of its existence as a movie, underscored by the last, lovely moment: A banquet at Queen Lil's place with Ben, his family, the whores and the crooks, united at table. The camera slowly withdraws to reveal the movie set, the lights hanging overhead, the power cables, the camp chairs, all isolated in a huge, dark soundstage. It's a graceful acknowledgement of everything that's gone before.","Nostalgia Warms 'Gaily, Gaily':Movie Based on Hecht Book Begins Its Run Beau Bridges Stars in Norman Jewison Film","MOTION PICTURES;Gaily, Gaily (Movie)",1969-12-17,article,Archives,Review

0,"Nurse loves her boss, a dentist. Pleasantly diverting and young Goldie's Oscar.","BROADWAY diehards who insist that a play, especially a long-running hit, never improves on the screen would do well to see ""Cactus Flower,"" opening yesterday at the Astor and Loew's Orpheum.As a light sex comedy, the play was a slicky entertaining, razzmatazz package and barrage of wise gags and even wiser cracks, brightened principally by the snap, bite and basso of Lauren Bacall. The Columbia adaptation, with a dandy cast headed by Ingrid Bergman, Walter Matthau and a newcomer, young Goldie Hawn, has more charm, credibility, flow and even bloom.To begin with, both the expansive scenario of I. A. L. Diamond and the flexible direction of Gene Saks open up and even ventilate the story, which is still a frail, chatty business about a philandering dentist, his young hippie mistress and the stoical receptionist-nurse who secretly loves him. The picture moves around comfortably in nice color, against some authentic Manhattan exteriors.But it is primarily the verve and skill of the performances, the pungent air of sexual chemistry and the peppery good humor that make the movie so diverting. Neither the wisecracks, old and new and generally funny, nor the characterizations seem as bland as on Broadway.The teaming of Matthau, whose dour, craggy virility now supplants the easy charm of Barry Nelson, and the ultra-feminine Miss Bergman, in a rare comedy venture, was inspirational on somebody's part. The lady is delightful as a (now) ""Swedish iceberg,"" no longer young, who flowers radiantly while running interference for the boss's romantic bumbling. The two stars mesh perfectly.And it comes as a pleasing jolt to find the youngster, Goldie Hawn, at the apex of the triangle, not only beautifully holding her own with the two veteran stars but also enhancing the content and flavor of the movie. This is the movie debut of the young actress, plucked from the ""Laugh-In"" television show. The role has been wisely and considerably fattened from the original play. And it is mainly the emerging sweetness and perception of this girl's character, as an inquisitive Greenwich Village kook, that gives the picture its persuasive luster and substance.The other members of the snug team are excellent, including Jack Weston, Rich Lenz, Vito Scotti, Eve Bruce and (welcome back) Irene Hervey. Finally, thanks to Hollywood Horticulture, ""Cactus Flower"" has sprouted in the right direction.",'Cactus Flower' Blooms,MOTION PICTURES;Cactus Flower (Movie),1969-12-17,article,Archives,Review

0,Mizoguchi's memorable drama of shattered family in ancient Japan. Sweeping and stunning.,"""THE BAILIFF,"" a Japanese film now playing at the New Yorker Theater, had its theatrical premiere at the Bleecker Street Cinema in September, at which time it was not reviewed. The present review intends to correct that omission and to reopen consideration of its director, the late Kenji Mizoguchi (1898-1956), whom film enthusiasts recognize as a supreme master but whom many intelligent moviegoers have never heard of. ""The Bailiff"" (more commonly known until now as ""Sansho Dayu"" or ""Sancho the Bailiff"") dates from 1954, a year after ""Ugetsu Monogatari,"" the only Mizoguchi film at all well-known to local audiences—out of a career that extended back to 1923 and that includes more than 40 movies, in the sound period alone.The film is set in 11th century Japan, when men could still own slaves. The bailiff of the title is such a slave owner, a powerful and cruel one, into whose hands fall Zushio and Anju, a young brother and sister, kidnapped children of a provincial governor who has been exiled for his kindness to peasants.The movie follows the children from before their kidnapping, through their 10 years of servitude to the Bailiff Sancho, until Zushio escapes and Anju drowns herself—so she cannot be tortured into informing on her brother. Zushio makes his way to the capital, Kyoto, pleads his case, learns that his father (now dead) is honored for his humanity, and is appointed governor of the province where Sancho has his compound.Zushio frees the slaves and then resigns his post so that he can search for his mother, who was sold into prostitution when her children were kidnapped. At the end he finds her, lame and blind, near a miserable hut on a distant island, sitting by the sea.I have given the barest outline of the plot, which is immensely complicated and full of events—of a sensational and ultimately exemplary nature. It is typical of the method of ""The Bailiff"" that during their captivity Zushio and Anju should overhear a song, sung by a newly acquired slave girl, about two lost children named Zushio and Anju. The song is a device, familiar to fable, by which the children learn that their mother is alive and where she is. But it also suggests that the children have already entered folk literature, that their misery is also their glory, and, in a sense, their identity.""The Bailiff"" has a creed, the children's father's belief that ""without mercy, man is like a beast,"" repeated many times in the subtitles and taken seriously by this very serious film. However, the film defines its characters as much by what they suffer as what they do, and its supreme quality, as in all the Mizoguichi I have seen, is its appreciation of lives lived by necessity rather than according to ideals.In its 2 hours and 5 minutes, ""The Bailiff"" covers almost 20 years of family history. The expanse of time is necessary to accommodate the accretion of events that change people—not to define character so much as to let them submit, to become a part of their environment. In Mizoguchi's world, the end of living is to achieve minimal differentiation from the landscape — like the daughter walking to her watery death or the mother sitting at the edge of the sea.""The Bailiff"" is a film of breathtaking visual beauty, but the conditions of that beauty also change — from the ethereal delicacy of its beginning (before the kidnapping), through the dark masses of the Bailiff's compound, to the ordered perspectives of Kyoto and the governor's palace, and finally to the spare symbolic horizons at the end.In effect, it moves from easy poetry to difficult poetry. Its impulses, which are profound but not transcendental, follow an esthetic program that is also a moral progression, and that emerges, with superb lucidity, only from the greatest art.",Screen: 'Bailiff' Returns:Folk Fable Set in Japan of the 11th Century,"MOTION PICTURES;Bailiff, The (Movie)",1969-12-17,article,Archives,Review

0,"Documentary about Chaplin, with clips.","KILLING the laughs in an hour and a half of Charlie Chaplin excerpts is a considerable, if worthless, feat. But ""The Funniest Man in the World,"" which opened yesterday at the Evergreen Bleecker Street Cinema, manages it handily by choosing second-rate material, cutting that material to pieces and pasting it together again with a narration that continually tells you when to laugh. Chaplin lovers, who have their season's gift in the revival of ""The Circus,"" may reasonably avoid ""The Funniest Man in the World,"" which seems little more than pedantic opportunism masquerading as film history.For reasons that I suspect have as much to do with questions of ownership as with taste, the film collects most of its pieces from Chaplin's Keystone Films (through 1914), together with some segments and out-takes from such Mutual Films (made in 1916-17) as ""The Count,"" ""The Rink"" and ""The Immigrant,"" and a few odd bits from newsreels and Chaplin imitations. Of the most important Chaplin, including, of course, everything made for the old United Artists (beginning in 1923), there is nothing.""The Funniest Man in the World"" makes a great point of leaving Chaplin, already a world figure at the age of 32, on the threshold of his major work in what it calls ""the universal art of the motion picture."" Which is a tactful way of admitting it treats only the minor work —and it treats that poorly.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. narrates a running commentary that, when it isn't telegraphing the humor, provides a baby movie course in identifying Chaplin's first film (""Making a Living""), the first appearance of the little tramp characterization (""Kid Auto Races at Venice""), the first movie Chaplin directed by himself (""Caught in a Cabaret""—the Theodore Huff filmography attributes this to Mabel Normand in collaboration with Chaplin), the first time Chaplin appeared with a child—and so on through a succession of firsts too trivial to mention. An artist's first works are often his least interesting. The evidence suggests that this is true for Chaplin, but the implications of such a proposition are outside the interests of ""The Funniest Man in the World.""Musical backgrounds have been provided for the excerpts—backgrounds of the sort in which a kettledrum booms every time somebody gets kicked in, or falls on, his behind. By contrast, Chaplin's own approach to scoring ""The Circus"" is a model of rectitude and willingness to let well enough alone.The only virtue for me, a small one, of ""The Funniest Man in the World"" (surely, the worst title of the year,) is in its presentation of early Chaplin imitations, which I had not seen before. These include an animated Chaplin cartoon, a Japanese Chaplin, his brother Sidney Chaplin as an exceptionally fat-in-the-hips Charlie and a very dark-eyed and expressive character actor who looks not at all like Chaplin but like Andrew Sarris with a mustache.",Screen: 'The Funniest Man in the World',"MOTION PICTURES;Funniest Man in the World, The (Movie)",1969-12-18,article,Archives,Review

0,"Matchmaker, heal thyself. Tuneful and tasty if overdecorated.","THIS may be the most superfluous film review ever written, with the possible exceptions of the notices for ""The Sound of Music"" or an esthétic-realist's appraisal of the record of the first moon walk.The screen adaptation of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" which began a reserved-seat engagement last night at the Rivoli Theater (after a private, somewhat violent, invitational premiere Tuesday night), is not invulnerable to criticism, but I suspect that Barbra Streisand is. At the age of 27, and for the very good reason that she is one of the few, mysteriously natural, unique performing talents of our time, she has become a National Treasure. Casting her as Dolly Levi (the ""née Gallagher"" has been dropped from the film), is rather like trying to display Yellowstone National Park in a one-geyser forest preserve.It doesn't really work, but most people probably couldn't care less. Miss Streisand is at that point of her career where her public personality invests everything in which she happens to appear with an importance and a resonance that have no relation to the vehicle itself.This ""Hello Dolly!"", reported to be the most expensive musical film ever made, has some nice things in it, especially a gigantic Hollywood set that re-creates Fifth Avenue and a large portion of New York City circa 1890. It is a marvelous achievement by the sort of craftsmen who built D. W. Griffith's Babylon on a Hollywood back lot in 1916. There also are a lot of lovely, artnouveau interiors and some idyllic, gingerbready exteriors shot in Garrison, N. Y., that masquerades as Yonkers.Gene Kelly, the director, and Ernest Lehmann, the producer who adapted the Broadway book, have thus ""opened up"" the original show. In every other respect, they have been reverential to the point of idiocy, since, by preserving something basically thin and often witless on a large movie screen, they have merely inflated the faults to elephantine proportions.David Merrick's ""Hello, Dolly!,"" the musical adaptation of Thorton Wilder's ""The Matchmaker,"" earlier called ""The Merchant of Yonkers"" (itself an adaptation of John Oxenford's 1835 one-acter, ""A Day Well Spent,"" and a later Austrian variation by Johann Nestroy), is still going strong—it played its 2,422d performance last night at the St. James—largely, I think, because it's been a practically perfect, sentimental showcase for any number of no-longer-young female stars.The Broadway musical is, basically, a one-number show — the great title tune sung to Dolly, the invincible matchmaker, and by her, when, after an absence of undisclosed duration for undisclosed reasons, she returns to the Harmonia Gardens, where she belongs. It's a moment of extraordinary theatrical artifice in that it evokes an emotion for which there has been absolutely no preparation.There also are some other pleasant songs (""Before the Parade Passes By,"" ""Elegance""), but the Jerry Herman score is generally so routine that it's difficult to distinguish between it and the ones he wrote later for ""Mame"" and ""Dear World."" The book, a farce designed to be framed by a proscenium, is serviceable nonsense about the ageless matchmaker, her campaign to win the stingiest, richest man in Yonkers for herself, plus some subsidiary adventures involving juveniles and ingenues.Miss Streisand's obvious youth and real sexuality obliterated any sense of nostalgia in the ""Hello, Dolly!"" number and add a curious ambiguity to other aspects of the role, including her speeches directed to Mr. Levi, her late husband. (I had the odd feeling that she must have been married to him at the age of 8 and lost him at 10). The star, a fine if limited comedienne, impersonates Dolly as a teen-age Mae West, circling around the role and finding laughs occasionally, but never quite committing herself to it.One result is that her best moments, with one exception, are provided by those songs that have nothing to do with the role as written—a new song, ""Love Is Only Love,"" on which she can exercise her sweet-tough upper register, and ""Before the Parade Passes By,"" which is done in the Streisand-Sousa manner. The exception is the wise and funny ""So Long Dearie,"" the song by which she irrevocably traps the irritable merchant (Walter Matthau). As in ""Funny Girl,"" Miss Streisand does not lip-sync her lyrics very well, which contributes to the detached cool of her performance.Matthau gives a good imitation of W. C. Fields to Miss Streisand's Mae West, but the picture is not his, nor is it the youngsters'—Michael Crawford, Marianne McAndrew and E. J. Peaker. It belongs to Miss Streisand, who visits it looking great (and something like an eccentric kewpie doll) in Irene Scharaff costumes, and to the production designer, John DeCuir.Gene Kelly, who directed two classic musicals with Stanley Donen (""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""On the Town""), here acts like a caretaker of a big, valuable property. He and Michael Kidd, his choreographer, have protected everything Gower Champion gave the original, and added nothing to the heritage of the musical screen except statistics.","On Screen, Barbra Streisand Displays a Detached Cool","MOTION PICTURES;Hello, Dolly!

0,Another James Bond. Got mixed reviews but we thought it nifty.,"A BARE fact must be faced. The superheated screen activities of Ian Fleming's supersleuth and sex symbol, James Bond, are as inevitable as sex or crime or ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" the sixth steaming annal in the sock 'em and spoof 'em spy series that crashed into the DeMille and other local theaters yesterday.Serious criticism of such an esteemed institution would be tantamount to throwing rocks at Buckingham Palace, but it does call for a handful of pebbles. Devotees will note that Sean Connery, the virile, suave conqueror of all those dastards and dames in the five previous capers, has given up his 007 Bond credentials to George Lazenby, a 30-year-old Australian newcomer to films. He's tall, dark, handsome and has a dimpled chin. But Mr. Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement.For the record, he plays a decidedly second fiddle to an overabundance of continuous action, a soundtrack as explosive as the London Blitz, and flip dialogue and characterizations set against some authentic, truly spectacular Portuguese and Swiss scenic backgrounds, caught in eyecatching colors.What are Bond's problems now? They're too numerous, as usual, to hold the constant attention of anyone other than a charter member of Her Majesty's Secret Service. What sets our bully boy off and fighting, running, shooting and loving this time is a lissome, leggy lass mysteriously bent on drowning herself in the waves thunderously crashing on a lonely Portuguese beach.First thing you know he's involved in a battle with two toughs that is as full of karate chops and belts in the belly as a brawl in a Singapore alley. To the credit of Richard Maibaum, the scenarist, the film's tongue-in-cheek attitude is set right at the outset. Once our new Bond emerges triumphant, he turns to the audience and says, somewhat plaintively: ""This never happened to the other fellow.""But it does. The lady of his life, the svelte Diana Rigg, who learned her karate chops from the British TV ""Avenger"" series, is the daughter of the blandly effete Gabriele Ferzetti, Mafioso-like tycoon, who likes Bond and wants to destroy that Spectre chief, Telly Savalas, his competition in world crime. That suits Bond too, and practically right off he's in Switzerland, where our villain maintains an eyrie atop an Alp.It's an inaccessible retreat, supposedly an institute for allergy research complete with hired guns, scientific gimmicks and an international conclave of allegedly allergic beauties who are really being brainwashed by the oily, bald-domed Mr. Savalas to spread his biological destruction of the world's food supply. Get it?Bond dallies with the dolls, of course, but the heart of the matter is a series of chases shot by the 41-year-old Peter Hunt, second unit director of the previous adventures, who's making his directorial debut with this one. The chases are breakneck, devastating affairs.A viewer must remember what seems to be the longest ski chase and bobsled run ever, full of gunfire and spills, that even includes an avalanche. There also is a decibel-filled fight amid clanging Swiss cow bells, the jarring bombing of that eyrie by helicopter-borne rescuers and the inadvertent clashes of the escaping Bond and Miss Rigg in a slithering, bang-up stock car race. One must say amen to a colleague's observation:""I never expected to see Switzerland defoliated like ""this.""It should be reported that the producers and distributors already have rung up a reported $82,200,000 on their first five Bond issues. It is not ungallant to report that Bond marries Miss Rigg, who is gunned down and killed by Savalas on their honeymoon. So it is reasonable to expect that Bond inevitably will be loving, shooting and running again.",Screen: New James Bond:George Lazenby Follows the Connery Pattern,MOTION PICTURES;On Her Majesty's Secret Service (Movie),1969-12-19,article,Archives,Review

0,"Spaceship. Intelligent viewpoint but runs out of oxygen, like the ship.","IT seems fitting that a handsome, professional and future-minded space drama in fine color, like ""Marooned,"" should open a new jewel box of a theater, the Ziegfeld.And should anything be more dramatic than the plight of three astronauts stranded in a malfunctioning craft and running out of oxygen as the rest of the world watches? Beamed in below, the galvanized Mission Space Center at Houston records every utterance, twitch and gasp aloft, with the agonized three wives at ringside. Suddently, in a last-minute rescue lunge, a one-man, bullet-like projectile spurts upward, straight through the eye of a hurricane. How's that for a cliff-hanger—planet-hanger?This ambitious, conscientious Columbia movie is admirably intelligent all the way, with a good cast headed by Gregory Peck (the ground chief), David Janssen (the rescue pilot) and Richard Crenna, James Franciscus and Gene Hackman (the marooned trio).It is simply not the thriller it was intended to be. An intermission—now reserved-seat policy—severs the tension and cripples the dramatic crescendo. Either because of or in spite of this unstrategic break, the picture hits its real stride at the two-thirds point, with the rescue mission launched and the human drama already fulfilled in some effective, connecting vignettes.Even with a story surprise, the stratospheric climax seems curiously antiseptic, after a long, claustrophobic wait inside the space ship, with the desperate man—and the picture—running low on oxygen.Minus a vital, culminative wallop, the film remains workmanlike. Leanly structured, crisply performed and beautifully directed by John Sturges, it neatly inter-weaves human behavior and scientific savvy.The theory here, in Mayo Simon's adaptation of the novel by the knowledgeable Martin Caidin, is that stratospheric pioneering justifies the danger of manpower loss. So declares Peck, as the mission commander, looking and sounding like his old ""Twelve O'clock High"" self. There is one exquisitely simple, loving exchange between Crenna and Lee Grant, her fingers tracing his speaking image on a tiny screen. The other two wives are Nancy Kovack and Mariette Hartley.There is not a note of music in the picture, only an electronic hum or beep-beep in the strikingly photographed sequences. The dialogue is as blunt and honest as the acoustics.""You may have put a man on the moon,"" a patrolman informs the speeding Peck, before connecting him on a car telephone with the President, ""but you're a menace to the highways.""If ""Marooned"" falls short as a soaring blockbuster, it does keep both feet on the ground.","The Screen: 'Marooned,' Space Film, Opens the New Ziegfeld:Story Built on Perils of Planetary Trips",MOTION PICTURES;Marooned (Movie),1969-12-19,article,Archives,Review

What happens to her there, and later, in the arms of amorous Rico, provides the story for ""Turn On to Love,"" a kind of soap opera au go go, which opened yesterday at the Bryant and the Rialto II.Nothing extraordinary happens; just a lot of perfectly normal love-making, which seems better to look at than most of the things people do to one another in the movies. Janice, played by Sharon Kent, is a very attractive girl, good at everything except reading her lines, and you know that when she cheats on her husband it's all for reasons of physical health, marital stability and psychic balance. ""Turn On to Love"" earns a real edge in the field of sex-cum-exposé because it respects its people and utterly avoids phony moral outrage.Indeed, whenever the movie seeks corruption it discovers adult education. The central orgy provides, in order: a useful demonstration of pot-smoking techniques, praise for music therapy and peace protests and an incredibly earnest and awkward explanation of the Hare Krishna.

During her two-day fling, Sharon takes Rico on a touristy tour of what once was the East Village.

0,"Marriage falling apart. Total turkey, but the score is nice.","IN Richard Brooks's new film, ""The Happy Ending,"" Ingrid Bergman clings to Humphrey Bogart on a balcony overlooking Paris as the Nazi army approaches. The world is falling apart, but they are in love. ""Is that a cannon,"" she asks dreamily, ""or is it my heart pounding?""""Casablanca"" may not be classic cinema literature, but it is so much better than ""The Happy Ending"" that one can only be amused at Brooks's idiotic self-confidence in allowing us to see television clips of the marvelous old Michael Curtiz movie in the course of his film. ""The Happy Ending"" is a kind of false ""Faces""—a movie that set out to expose the kitsch of Hollywood fantasy.Brooks wrote, directed and produced ""The Happy Ending,"" and cast his wife, Jean Simmons, in the leading role. Mary Wilson is a beautiful bored Denver housewife who, after 16 years of marriage, has taken to drink and pills. The screenplay says it's because she feels unloved and unwanted, and because she's getting old. Anyone who sees the film may suspect it's simply to escape the relentless philosophizing that swirls around her head in Denver, in Nassau, at cocktail parties, on the beach, at the beauty parlor—as if she were some sort of chic cracker barrel.The poor woman goes to hock her wedding band, but is told by the pawnbroker: ""Who wants someone else's heartache?"" Says her bar-tender of booze: ""One drink's too many, and a thousand's not enough."" ""When she finally attempts suicide, even the nurse at the hospital won't quit: ""Vodka and Seconal—marriage on the rocks.""Nothing that Brooks has done before — certainly not ""The Professionals,"" not ""In Cold Blood"" nor ""Elmer Gantry,"" not even his presumptuous adaptations of ""The Brothers Karamazov"" and ""Lord Jim""—prepares us for the fatuousness of ""The happy Ending."" The screenplay is the sort that Joseph L. Mankiewicz would have rewritten and ennobled with wit and that Delmer Daves would have treated with the romantic solemnity due a soap opera. Brooks, however, presents it as serious social commentary, complete with startlingly quick flashbacks to make the narrative structure seem complex (it isn't), expensive location filming, a few four-letter words and references to real things like impotency, taxes, Nixon's inauguration and Marlboro commercials.Even more unpleasant is his ""Mondo Cane""-like exploitation of the fears and anxieties of middle-aged ladies seeking salvation through facials, breast-lift surgery, exercycles and reducing machines. Miss Simmons teeters around quite a lot clutching a bottle of vodka, at one point gets her stomach pumped out, and often looks lovely.John Forsythe, as her husband, has another one of those hopelessly anonymous roles that catapulted him to stardom, and Nanette Fabray, of all people, plays a wise-cracking, non-singing, maid.",Screen: 'Happy Ending' Begins Its Run:Heroine Bested by Life -- Or by Philosophy,"MOTION PICTURES;Happy Ending, The (Movie)",1969-12-22,article,Archives,Review

0,Shakespeare's melancholy Danish prince avenges his father's murder.,"DESPITE the text in the newspaper ad, ""To thine own thing be true . . .,"" the Tony Richardson ""Hamlet,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, makes no particular claims to modernity or to contemporary relevance. And despite the illustration for the same ad, showing Hamlet (Nicol Williamson) about to nibble the up-slung shoulder of Ophelia (Marianne Faithfull), it isn't a sexy ""Hamlet,"" either. The ad wins my vote for the most tasteless of the year in its field (always a very hot competition). But the movie upon which it is based is a traditional and bowdlerized version of Shakespeare's play.The text has been cut to ribbons. Although Nicol Williamson talks very fast, this version, running 114 minutes—as against 153 minutes for the 1948 Laurence Olivier film of ""Hamlet""—eliminates some of his role, much of everybody else's role, and almost all of what serves to locate physically and to amplify the action. As a result, Hamlet's presence is magnified out of all proper relationship to the world around him.And since the film is shot perhaps 95 per cent in fairly extreme close-up, it is not so much his presence as his head that continually dominates the screen. ""Hamlet"" from the neck up (with an occasional Ophelia from the neck down, to acknowledge Miss Faithfull's charming cleavage) offers less, even to the mind's eye, than you might imagine.The production is full of ideas. Richardson has photographed his film against total blackness except for a few dark brick walls and passage-ways to represent the battlements), with only the most essential properties, often in front of his actors' faces. He thus provides a foreground, but very little background. And, because he is at pains to include among the properties a candle flame of greater or lesser brilliance, we have the notion of ""idea"" or, more accurately, an emblem for ""idea,"" as a metaphor for the play.However, the production only succeeds in making it look as if all of ""Hamlet"" took place at night. And at certain moments, for example the appearance of the Ghost (who does not appear, but is represented by particularly bright light, some science-fiction movie flying-saucer music, and Nicol Williamson's prerecorded voice), it achieves, for all its gestures toward spare efficiency, a kind of square theatrical ridiculousness.People whose opinions I greatly respect tell me that the Williamson-Richardson stage production of ""Hamlet,"" which I did not see, was both vital and moving. I can believe that, because the one piece of outright stage business in the movie, the play within the play, is handled with great style and intelligence. But in his approach to film, Richardson has used the medium to close in rather than to open up the drama, and the result, though not without honor, is quite without interest. Because we have so little of Hamlet's world, we scarcely have Hamlet. The final deaths, which are shown in great functional detail, offer less for pity or terror than in any other production I have experienced.Except for Nicol Williamson's Hamlet and Mark Dignam's very fine sly Polonius, the major players range from the nondescript to the unspeakable. Williamson talks with what sounds like an intentional lower-class accent; Claudius seems to have immigrated from Wales, and everybody else speaks standard stage English.Williamson has never seemed to me a good actor for the movies (just as Tony Richardson has never seemed a good director of movies), working always with a kind of projected intelligence that may carry in the theater but that in film merely screens the person from the camera. There is nothing especially distinctive about his face, he is further hampered by having to act with a Horatio (Gordon Jackson) whom he more closely resembles than, in this production, Rosencrantz resembles Guildenstern. Nevertheless, the mind that informs the performance reads the lines, and at its pleasantest the production is distinguished by many original and right-sounding decisions about speeches.Playing on the same bill is a 5-minute animated short by Ryan Larkin, called ""Walking,"" in its imaginative spaciousness and fine observation—literally, of people walking across or up and down the screen—it offers a reasonable clue to the quality of the nine-tenths of life excluded from the Tony Richardson ""Hamlet.""",Williamson as 'Hamlet':Richardson Film Based on Debated Version,MOTION PICTURES;Hamlet (Movie),1969-12-22,article,Archives,Review

0,An English girl joins two American buddies in an old car on a summer tour of Europe.,"JAMES SALTER'S ""Three,"" which opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater, is based on an Irwin Shaw story. ""Then We Were Three,"" that epitomizes the tones and attenuations of much middle-class fiction of the early 1950's. Three Americans just out of college, two boys and a girl, are winding up their summer vacation in Europe. They have been to the right places and had the good experiences that were the legacy of the literature of one postwar generation to the life of another. The girl is open and inaccessible — the way so many desirable girls were in those days. One of the boys is shy and sensitive, gifted with a mildly poetic sense of ""instantaneous nostalgia"" according to his friend, and it is through his eyes that we see how he loses the girl and bids goodby to the last free summer before succumbing to maturity.In adapting the story, Salter has chosen not to use a point-of-view character. He has vastly added events and has updated the action, but nevertheless retains the sensibility of the early 1950's. In large measure, the film is really about that sensibility, with its unspoken codes of honor and its own brand of instantaneous nostalgia. Marty (Charlotte Rampling) parades through southern Europe as if she were a veritable demonstration of what a tasteful girl can choose from among the less expensive mod fashions. But the old-fashioned question of her life and the sustaining interest of the film is: will she or will she not go to bed with somebody.The sexual hang-up is perhaps no less anachronistic, though surely less pleasant, than the film's unspoiled seacoasts, uncluttered spaces and picnic lunches out of wicker baskets. But with so little else going for it, ""Three"" almost has to fall back on incidentals that should have remained by the way. So it offers touristy vignettes, local color and spectacular landscapes, seascapes and city views—from extreme but always flattering perspectives.In method, ""Three"" strives for amateur status without ever quite achieving it. The visual asides purposely avoid strong dramatic point; the prettiness that pervades every scene is meant to seem more like chance discovery than design. The dialogue is often postrecorded to provide a voice-over continuity to long shots—and the technique doesn't work very well. Even that failure suggests a kind of casualness toward the business of making a movie—a casualness more gratifying in intention than in results.None of the leading actors is convincing, or even appealingly unconvincing. Sam Waterston plays shy sensitivity along lines too well established by Anthony Perkins many years ago. Robie Porter curiously dilutes his character's masculine drive into smiles and easy affability. And Charlotte Rampling is too ambiguous, too withdrawn and too haggard to convey the free-floating but alert vitality that is the girl's claim to attention.Relationships are never sufficiently clear. Of course the relationships are not meant to be clear, but in this film they are not even mysterious. They are simply underdeveloped. The characters spend vast amounts of time lying on their backs or sitting with downcast eyes, not saying much, scarcely acknowledging the moves in the games of dominance they are presumably playing.To construct a movie out of intervals, silences, glances and pauses in acting out an anecdote that is not very intense to begin with, is unavoidably to substitute mood for drama. I appreciate James Salter's nostalgia, but I resent the nature of his call to share in it. He appeals too much and demonstrates too little. In its handsome vistas and personal reticence ""Three"" sustains no better quality than the wordless fluidity and unexamined emotion of its background music.",Screen: End of a Summer in Europe:James Salter Adapts Irwin Shaw Story,MOTION PICTURES;Three (Movie),1969-12-24,article,Archives,Review

0,"FOR perhaps two minutes, at the beginning and again at the very end, ""Juliette de Sade,"" now playing at the Rialto East and the Rialto West, succeeds as erotic movie making. In those minutes we are offered close-ups of the star's thighs, her lips, a poised cigarette, her invitational eyes—put together in slow, straightforward montage as a kind of monumental tease. Such moments of colossal intimacy, of passionate secrets shared with a movie screen, are of course their own reward. But in ""Juliette de Sade"" they are too meager and too few to validate the film.For the 81 intervening minutes, the same young lady, Maria Pia Conte, offers us almost nothing at all. This is the first time I have seen a movie with pretensions to pornography in which the principal actress never disrobes for the audience. Because she leads a life of willing sin and dissolution, she is continually in situations (bed, for example) where she ought to be undressed. But she never visibly is, and the resulting calisthenics devoted to holding the sheets up under the chin or keeping the beach towel from falling off would have done credit to, say, the athletic purity of Doris Day in her most embattled moments.Based, according to the distributor, on Sade's ""Juliette,"" the film concerns a precocious young thing who leaves her convent school quickly behind and comes to conquer mad, mod, swinging Rome. She finds a roommate, buys a lot of new clothes and meets an evil old man with a walrus moustache. He declares himself a follower of the divine Marquis de Sade, a name that from, the pleasure principles the old man elaborates, might as well be a pseudonym for Jeremy Bentham. He promises to instruct Juliette in his ""philosophy."" Connoisseurs of the genre will recognize that ""philosophy"" is always a dirty word when muttered in the presence of a leggy blonde, but in this film it might as well be a system of Kantian imperatives for all the bad that comes from it.So the old man gives her a new car, has her over to dinner with some friends and plays a game of chess with her. For a time she accepts this corruption. (""I had Rome where I wanted it, in the palm of my hand. And I wasn't going to let go until I had squeezed it dry,"" exults Juliette's voice, English-dubbed, while her yellow-green Lamborghini P400 zips past St. Peter's.) And it is here, on the beaches and in the middle-class apartments of Rome, that the film's imaginative poverty (not depravity) shows itself to worst effect.""Juliette de Sade"" means to suggest a sensualism of rich ornamentation and of plastic surfaces. Like most movies of its type, the film pretends to private knowledge in addition to sex, and to forbidden mysteries beyond the body.But, unlike most movies of its type, it supports those pretenses with fairly classy production values and handsome photography. It falls victim to its own aspirations, and to a tone of prissy elegance. Typically, Miss Conte, though she never strips, does indulge in a singularly unexciting fashion show.Before she breaks away from her sponsor—to set up in business for herself—Juliette suffers an LSD trip and an orgy. Nothing in the trip (the worst in a miserable tradition) deserves description. But during the orgy, which consists of two men and three women eating grapes, etc., Juliette's roommate does an erotic dance around, over and up against a pint-sized reproduction of Michelangelo's ""David."" The scene is supposed to be tense with energy and illusion, but the girl slithers without conviction, and the little David, a model of outmoded decorum, hides his plaster with a fig leaf.","FOR perhaps two minutes, at the beginning and again at the very end, ""Juliette de Sade,"" now playing at the Rialto East and the Rialto West, succeeds as erotic movie making.
