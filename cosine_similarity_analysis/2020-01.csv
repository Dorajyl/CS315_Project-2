0,“Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice” airs on CNN. And a new season of “Doctor Who” kicks off on BBC America.,"LINDA RONSTADT: THE SOUND OF MY VOICE (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. “If I were going to choose something to do, it would not be to stand up in front of a lot of people,” the singer Linda Ronstadt says in this documentary. “But I love to sing, I love to sing, I love music. So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music.” That’s not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn’t have the typical rock star’s career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (“People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself,” she says in the documentary, “but I never invented myself to start with.”) Her varied career is the focus here; it’s discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. “The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He wrote that Ronstadt’s “cleareyed, down-to-earth thoughts on her profession, her family and American culture (musical and otherwise) make her someone you want to know better.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: A Linda Ronstadt Doc and ‘Doctor Who’,Television;Movies,2020-01-01,article,Arts,News

0,A drama based on a miraculous Missouri incident airs on HBO. And Lifetime airs a follow-up to its much-viewed R. Kelly documentary series.,"BREAKTHROUGH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. A tragedy happens on ice — and an apparent miracle happens off it — in this faith-based drama from the TV veteran Roxann Dawson. The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital — but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the community’s subsequent push to aid in John’s recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film “tells the story of John’s miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization,” Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, “the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Breakthrough’ and ‘Surviving R.

It was also the first book I signed up, so it had special significance. That moment, every Wednesday afternoon, when the list shows up in our inboxes, is always fun — tense, too. There’s this moment of quiet as the attachment opens, and then you hear screams and claps and hell yesses echoing over the floor. ‘The Power of Habit’ had two publicists, a production editor, several marketers and designers, a serial rights person and a sales force that had been working for months to make it a success. It’s rare that a book hitting the list is a total surprise, but there are nail-biters and books that hit higher than we expected and that’s a beautiful thing … but not as beautiful as making that call to an author who has worked so hard to make her book a reality and telling her that she is an official NYT best seller.

There are also pockets of nature amid the bustle. In Santo Domingo Este, a short drive from the city center, is an underground lake where Taíno women once bathed.

It is here that the Tokyo-based architect, designer, restaurateur and chef Shinichiro Ogata has set his latest project — Ogata Paris, a newly opened multistory complex comprising a tea shop and tea salon, a full-service restaurant, a pastry shop, a bar, an art gallery, and a crafts and houseware store. It is a tour de force of one man’s vision of the best Japan has to offer; nearly every detail, from the cocktails to the glasses in which they’re served, has been designed by Ogata himself. It’s also his first solo foray into France, though his considered approach — to seek beauty and balance in all things — is the same one that’s governed all of his pursuits, including a bistro set in a plum tree-filled garden in Tokyo’s residential Meguro Ward and a collection of tree-free bamboo and bagasse paper plates made to look as thin and refined as china.

In effect, “they murdered Weldonville.” Two years later, Lt. Leah Hawkins is put on leave from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and unofficially licensed to hunt and kill the 12 ringleaders, now scattered across the country.","Crime Sprees, Both Creepy and Comic","Books and Literature;A Small Town (Book);Perry, Thomas;When Old Midnight Comes Along (Book);Estleman, Loren D;Naked Came the Florida Man (Book);Dorsey, Tim;The Playground (Book);Shemilt, Jane",2020-01-03,article,Books,News

Ari Aster made waves in 2018 with the release of his debut feature, “Hereditary.” A year later, he delivered another haunting watch, “Midsommar.” The protagonists, Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), are on the verge of breaking up until a family tragedy brings them closer. Not close enough, that is, as Christian is emotionally detached while a grieving Dani clings onto him for comfort. Months later, Christian reluctantly invites Dani to join him and his friends at a festival in a remote Swedish village that occurs every 90 years. The group arrives at the sun-kissed landscape in awe, until they realize they have entered the terrain of a pagan cult. Needless to say, terror ensues. Aster tried to center the horror around Dani and Christian’s deteriorating relationship, yet critics have said their back story was not given enough weight to begin with. Aster’s real strength, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, “is the setup, that part when he lays out his characters, their worlds and the menace that closes on them like a claw.” ",What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Midsommar’ and ‘Dracula’,Movies;Television,2020-01-04,article,Arts,News

Dio never became a household name, but he is considered one of the great heavy-metal vocalists of all time, up there with Ozzy Osbourne (whom he replaced in Black Sabbath) and metal-adjacent rockers like Axl Rose and Robert Plant. Beginning in the 1970s, Dio took a lead role in codifying a number of his genre’s most ludicrous, yet utterly foundational, conventions. He sang of wolves and demons, toured with an animatronic dragon and supposedly introduced the splay-fingered “devil horns” headbanger’s salute, which he claimed his Italian grandmother used to flash as an old-world method of warding off the malocchio and other forms of bad luck.",Old Musicians Never Die.

San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month.

So she sets out to start living a life she won’t regret, guided by a to-do list: move into her own flat, ride a motorcycle, “do something bad,” etc. All she manages to cross off is the moving part, but in doing so she meets Red, her new building’s super and a man stuck in his own pause; when his relationship imploded, he didn’t know how to continue the art career his abusive girlfriend had been so integral to. When they meet, Red thinks Chloe is an icy snob; Chloe thinks Red hates her. And Red thinks he hates her, too — her discomfort does manifest as rudeness! — but when he rescues Chloe from rescuing a kitten from a tree, he starts to see beneath her facade. When she soon discovers that Red owns a motorcycle, she enlists his help in checking items off her list. With GET A LIFE, CHLOE BROWN (369 pp., Avon, paper, $15.99), Talia Hibbert shows how standard romance tropes — misunderstandings, meddling sisters, a steamy camping trip — can be elevated to sublime pleasure in the hands of a brilliant writer.

This new dark drama series reinvents the 2018 Stephen King novel of the same name, to thrilling effect. The show starts out with an investigation into a boy’s murder in small-town Georgia. The cop on the case, Ralph (Ben Mendelsohn), and a private investigator, Holly (Cynthia Erivo), find clear-cut evidence against a local Little League coach named Terry (Jason Bateman, who also directed the first two episodes).

Yet Holly urges him to keep an open mind if they want to get to the bottom of the murder. The one factor that may convince Ralph to see beyond cold hard facts is that he just lost his son and is looking for answers of his own.",What’s on TV Sunday: ‘The Outsider’ and ‘Sanditon’,Movies;Television,2020-01-12,article,Arts,News

By my American standards G. was late, and as I waited for him I browsed the book stalls the square is famous for, their wares piled high under awnings in front of the city library. Really it wasn’t a fountain anymore, it had been shuttered for years, since faulty wiring stopped a man’s heart one summer as he dipped his fingers into the cool water there. It was December now, though winter hadn’t yet really taken hold; the sun was out and the weather was mild, it wasn’t unpleasant to stand for a bit and browse the books on display. From the beginning of the year G. had caught my attention, at first simply because he was beautiful, and then for the special quality of friendship I thought I saw between him and another boy in my class, the intensity with which G. sought him out and the privacy he drew about them. It was familiar to me, that intensity, a story from my own adolescence, as was the basking ambivalence with which the other boy received it, how he both invited it and held it off. I had some idea, then, what we would talk about, and why school didn’t offer enough secrecy for us to talk about it there, but I was still curious: he wasn’t a student I was particularly close to, he didn’t stop by my room outside of class, he had never confided in me or sought me out, and I wondered what crisis was bringing him to me now.","‘Cleanness,’ by Garth Greenwell: An Excerpt",,2020-01-17,article,Books,Review

Here, he documents what goes on behind the scenes.","An Italian portrait gallery — a pinacoteca, filled with antique paintings from the family collection — would be a fitting backdrop for an Etro show any season. After all, the brand is the consummate family business, founded in 1968 by Gimmo Etro and now helmed by his four children: Kean, who designs men’s wear; Jacopo, who designs home goods and accessories; Ippolito, who handles brand strategy; and Veronica, who designs women’s wear. (Even Kean’s 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns — especially paisley. But for Etro’s fall 2020 men’s wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery. And, looming over the runway, was a pinacoteca: a collage of 19th-century portraits, some of them depicting the Etros of centuries past.",An Italian Designer Shares an Intimate Glimpse of His Fashion Week,Fashion and Apparel;Fashion Shows;Men and Boys;Etro SpA;Design,2020-01-17,article,T Magazine,News

Topics like Israel and  Palestine, institutional racism and L.G.B.T. issues all break down into circular conversations in which I have to defend my more-left-wing stances, which they regard as idealistic and childish. While my relatives respect that my views are changing as I learn and grow, they’ve never been challenged by a person from my generation before.",Should I Tell My Aunt That Her Costume Is Racist?,Race and Ethnicity;Discrimination;Workplace Environment;Ethics (Personal),2020-01-21,article,Magazine,News

Now I, and many others I’m sure, worry that a catastrophe is looming, and wonder how we can guard against it. Schoolchildren are now taught: “Be an upstander, not a bystander!” History, we’re told, shows that, as Edmund Burke supposedly said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” Or in the words of historian Ian Kershaw, “The road to Auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference.” These aphorisms pithily conjure up images of wise men stroking their long white beards, but they’re wrong.",The Road to Auschwitz Wasn’t Paved With Indifference,"Holocaust and the Nazi Era;War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity;Ethics (Personal);Jews and Judaism;Philosophy;Auschwitz Concentration Camp",2020-01-21,article,Opinion,Op-Ed

0,Patrick Stewart returns to “Star Trek” in a new streaming show. And a “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff begins its third season on ABC.,"STAR TREK: PICARD Stream on CBS All Access. “Tea, Earl Grey, decaf.” That’s Jean-Luc Picard’s new beverage order in “Picard,” the latest “Star Trek” TV series and a return to the franchise for Patrick Stewart, who plays the title character. (For those not hip enough for “Star Trek” references: The order used to be “tea, Earl Grey, hot.”) The new show finds Picard — the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise — in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Star Trek: Picard’ and ‘Station 19',Television;Movies,2020-01-23,article,Arts,News

The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in “The Curse of La Llorona,” a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the film’s title: She’s cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) “More efficient than ambitious, ‘La Llorona’ is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.” One of the movie’s producers is James Wan, known for the “Saw” and “Conjuring” movies.

0,Gideon Glick shines — and sings — in a moving Off Broadway revival of “Little Shop of Horrors.”,"“He’s a strange little man.” That’s how the New York actor Gideon Glick describes Seymour Krelborn, the menschy, dorky, ultimately murderous antihero of the cult classic musical “Little Shop of Horrors,” whom Glick, 31, is currently playing through March in an Off Broadway revival that runs at the Westside Theater. The production opened in October with the actor Jonathan Groff in the role, but Glick, who was at the time starring as Dill Harris in Aaron Sorkin’s Broadway adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” filled in for two weeks in November when Groff had a conflict. At the end of that temporary stint — during which Glick’s deep skills as one of New York’s best contemporary character actors (namely, his ability to channel his own inherent strangeness, his high voice often cracking, his knees seemingly quaking) were on full, glorious display — the director, Michael Mayer, asked if he wanted to take over the role after Groff finished his contract.","The Queer, Half-Deaf Actor Redefining the Idea of a Leading Man","Glick, Gideon;Little Shop of Horrors (Play);Theater;ACTORS AND ACTRESSES",2020-01-31,article,T Magazine,News
